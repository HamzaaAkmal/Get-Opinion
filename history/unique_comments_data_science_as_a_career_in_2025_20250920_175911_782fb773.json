          "text": "@@johnwig285 Yes, a data engineer should be cleaning up the data. But in my experience:<br><br>1. Many ‚Äúdata‚Äù engineers are ‚Äúprocess‚Äù engineers with little understanding of the data.  I.e., if their cleanup process runs, then the data is good. <br><br>2. Many senior managers and data customers think that the data presented to them is in roughly the same for as the source data. I.e., they don‚Äôt realize that many datasets are the combination of multiple source sub-datasets. All of which need to be clean. <br><br>3. Data engineers need to understand the business meaning of the data that they are scrubbing. Many companies have different businesses with different categories of customers THAT DO NOT MIX.  Understanding those categories, identifying the parameters of each category, and accurately categorizing each customer into the correct category is CRITICAL.  Without understanding the business meaning of their data, how is a data engineer going to clean the data?<br><br>4. In the real world outside of a lab, all data needs to be scrubbed and not just a sample. And this data needs to be live data, not manually created data for modeling. To be sure, some data elements need to be secured for privacy.  But the semantics canNOT be corrupted. Uniqueness,cardinality, nullability, domain, etc. must be maintained. <br><br>In one project, the compass position of a customer was a critical identifier.  Unfortunately a database engineer determined that NULLS would not be allowed in the database. I.e., it was a ‚Äúdirty‚Äù condition.  The rule was that all NULLS must be converted to a 0.  So they bounced a a dataset that I had scrubbed back to me, screaming <br>‚ÄúCOVERT NULLS TO ZERO‚Äù!<br><br>I fought that but lost. It turns out that the data was poor, and customer compass position was NULL for something like 90% of customers. After replacing all those NULLS with zero, the database engineers were happy and my dataset was deemed ‚Äúgood‚Äù. That until the end users saw the data. The went ballistic saying, ‚Äúhow can 90% of customers be True North?!?‚Äù (0 degrees on the compass). <br><br>So instead of identifying an issue that could be addressed, the data was corrupted because there was no way of separating the plugged 0‚Äôs from the rows where the customer WAS due North.  <br><br>This is a true story, not a fictional story to make a point. Unfortunately it‚Äôs an example of what the real world is like. Arrogance, incompetence, politics, and ignorance is out there.  Technical competence is not good enough.  A good data engineer has to know a lot more",

The six-person team worked 80 to 100 hours a week for four weeks every fiscal quarter. It was brutal. So I went to my boss and said can I build an analytical model using a financial forecasting system?  He said go for it.<br><br>I spent a month designing and building a forecasting system using a mainframe software. I tested this using prior month‚Äôs data. After testing, we went live with it.  The team I was on was six people.   Each of them hand-collected data for two weeks and gave it to me for data entry. The system worked perfectly but the data was dirty. Most of the two weeks was cleaning the data. <br><br>After the forecast was finished, I decided it was stupid to hand enter all the data.  But, the dirty data made that impossible. Each team member still had to work a few hours a week gathering data, but that was nothing for the 80+ hours per week that we worked before. The team was VERY happy with my work and me.  So I was promoted and they hired a data entry person.  <br><br>This is an example of a real world situation in the early days of my career. The business problem was that the team was wasting 2,000 man hours per quarter doing a forecast.  And not doing the job that we were hired for. (We were business develop managers)<br><br>The message here is that you need to solve a business problem. The ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù problem could be any business, research team, medical team, etc. We need to roughly understand that problem and learn the tools to solve it. <br><br>Understand the process first. Let the results come later.",

I suspect only a few people in 2005 would have predicted today's range of mobile devices, app ecosystems, and cloud services with any confidence.\nThat said, in the medium term my own personal (i.e. not Microsoft's!) predictions are:\n(1.) Further commoditization of IT services in the cloud, with reach to all kinds of devices.\n(2.) Growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) and all of the data capture, modelling, analysis, and automated predictive logic that goes with it.\n(3.) Tools and services that make specialized data science skills more prevalent (and easer to use) in businesses and other organizations.\nNow - what will you give me in 10 years if I'm right?",

There are so many different jobs in this huge company that the requirements are different in many areas for the career paths here.\n\nYou start at the http://career site and find jobs that match your qualifications and skill set.  Then you apply and upload your resume.  If your skill set matches, you could be placed into a pool of candidates who qualify for that job.  It then moves to an interview process where you spend an entire day being interviewed by team members for technical skill, personality traits, etc.\n\nIn all honesty, certifications and certificates are only a part of the overall picture that hiring managers look for.  When I got hired, the job description indicated they were looking for a Bachelor of Science in computing and Microsoft certifications.  I had the certifications but not the university degree.  I was still hired based on my experience, knowledge, and expertise in the area.\n\nSince then, I am working to complete a combined Bachelor/Master degree online because I want that degree as a personal achievement.

What Bill Nye did for you is something that he did for a lot of people, which was to inspire an interest in science. He opened people's minds.

My department supports the academic departments, faculty and research labs at a college that is part of a large university.  Since we support everything from Women's Studies to Physics, the amount of software is huge.  We also support the computers connected to various data collection equipment such as microscopes and mass spectrometers.  Maintaining security while providing for academic freedom is a challenge.  I never touched a computer until I started getting my degree back in 1983 (Business Computer Information Systems and Quantitative Methods).  I went back to school after having a baby and quickly realizing I didn't like being poor.  I chose computing since the job market was so good.  After I graduated, I decided that I would try to get a job in a business that I could feel good about supporting, hence higher ed.  I was able to get a Masters for free while working (Information Management and Policy). \n\nIf I was starting today, I think I would become a data visualization specialist.  I did some stats in the beginning of my career (SAS on a VAX/VMS system, I'm old) and really enjoyed massaging data into shape.  I think doing the visualization would add creativity to the mix.

I'm a bit of a full stack developer (ie I do the front end, back end and database stuff) but I mostly stick to front end as that is my strength. \n\nI kinda fell into this, honestly. I started learning HTML/CSS when I was in middle school, and by the time high school came around and I took the website design class, I was teaching the teacher stuff. He told me about AP Computer Science, so I took that and excelled at it. From there, I did a work-based learning program my senior year and had an internship at a local business and got to work on a web app there. My boss was super chill and basically said \"here's what we want, have fun figuring it out\" so there was a lot of self-teaching involved, but it was very useful knowledge. \n\nSo after having taken AP Comp Sci, I realized it was a degree I could get (because prior to this, I had no clue what I wanted to do with my life). And so I went to college for this. I didn't know specifically what I wanted to do, but I at least knew \"programming.\" But because of all my prior experience with web programming, I preferred that because I Was already good at it. So my last summer of college, I got an internship at a bigger company and did great. And now I work there full time.",

I find that my network has been especially generous with introductions during this time, and don't hesitate to even go through third degree connections.\n\nAnother possible avenue is going directly through 3rd-party recruiters or headhunters for the types of job that you're looking for. These third party headhunters (they are especially common for finance/quantitative trading jobs) get a commission for each of their referrals who ultimately gets hired, so they are incentive-aligned to try to share your resume as broadly as possible.\n\nFinally, I think that being organized can help-- when I was job searching for the past few months, I had a spreadsheet where I kept all of the links to jobs I'd applied for, as well as whether I had heard back. That helped me figure out that I was getting the most replies for the Data Science roles I was applying to, so I doubled down there.\n\nPossible job titles to be looking for: data analyst, data scientist, business analyst, quantitative analyst, software engineer - data science, product analyst\n\nPossible areas to look into: consumer technology (Facebook, Google, etc.), startups (good place to start might be at Y-Combinator companies?), biotechnology + healthcare, science, data science instruction (like teaching at Lambda School or a data science bootcamp)\n\nWishing you the best of luck!\n\n\\-OA",

In statistics we look at the data and try to either present its distribution properties or to extrapolate using it in order to make predictions. Do you think that this practice puts statistics in a lower position compared to the other sciences that are laying theories and can perform test to show it's significance?",

      "text": "As someone who hadn't even thought of majoring in Statistics until I took my first undergrad course in it (Harvard's Stat 110, Introduction to Probability with Joe Blitzstein), I think a student's first experience with Statistics can have a very real impact on how scary it seems.\n\nPart of what makes Stat 110 so fun (you can view the lectures [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2SOU6wwxB0uwwH80KTQ6ht66KWxbzTIo)) is that Joe couches everything in terms of real-world examples that make the information seem immediately applicable. He teaches each of the distributions in terms of \"stories\": the exponential distribution is taught in terms of waiting times for a bus; the Poisson distribution is taught in terms of the number of chocolate chips on a chocolate chip cookie. They immediately feel relatable and applicable.\n\nAnother great course to gain inspiration from that's a bit more on the \"Data Science\" side but also approachable and fun is [https://cs109.github.io/2015/](https://cs109.github.io/2015/).  \n\nPersonally, I still find that the most mind-bending parts around Statistics are around randomness -- what does it *mean* for an event to be random and how can we get used to switching from the mathematical world of determinism to the statistical world of randomness? I write a bit more about that [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-graduate-students-perspective-on-statistics-5cb6ca643689?source=---------2------------------), and perhaps untangling this confusion might be helpful for new students.\n\nFinally, I think Statistics can come easier to some students than others. I think that having plenty of office hours and opportunities for students to seek help, especially at the beginning, can be really important -- and structuring them in a way that the students who need the most help will come to them is perhaps even more important :)\n\n\\-OA",

That helped me figure out that I was getting the most replies for the Data Science roles I was applying to, so I doubled down there.\n\nPossible job titles to be looking for: data analyst, data scientist, business analyst, quantitative analyst, software engineer - data science, product analyst\n\nPossible areas to look into: consumer technology (Facebook, Google, etc.), startups (good place to start might be at Y-Combinator companies?), biotechnology + healthcare, science, data science instruction (like teaching at Lambda School or a data science bootcamp)\n\nWishing you the best of luck!\n\n\\-OA",

In real life data collection, there are a number of reasons the number may not be \"nice\" due to external factors, not due to data manipulation. For example, I worked in a neuroscience lab that one study did about 20 different tasks in a session. Sometimes the patient would refuse a task (we had one that involved a painful stimulation) or there would be a mechanical failure, that we didn't notice at the time. In then cleaning the data even though we maybe set out for 3000 people, we would lose some in the clean up. Or another thing that could happen is an original analysis had 3000 people, and someone wanted to run a secondary analysis on participants that fit some criteria. Maybe not all 3000 people did , so that's why you end up with the weird number.",

It creates extremely long math problems based on all this varied data to accurately predict what someone with all of your past and present traits is interested in.

      "text": "I'm a PhD candidate (defending in a week!) in computer science in the US. I'm going to paste a comment I wrote on the r/science post for more visibility:\n\nOpen and free science has been integral to the scientific movement since the Enlightenment era. It has long been understood that unfettered scientific research has long-lasting positive impacts. While much research over the past 300 years has been a dead-end, valuable knowledge by itself, much has become far more beneficial and useful than we ever imagined when conducting it.\n\nI think we're all familiar with stories of scientists who died before knowing how impactful their work would become, such as Gregor Mendel, Charles Darwin, Alan Turing, Ludwig Boltzmann, Ignaz Semmelweis, Hannah Arendt, Jane Jacobs, and Ferdinand de Saussure. \n\nEnlightenment principles support unfettered research:\n* Faith in reason -- that rational inquiry ultimately leads to progress\n* Knowledge for its own sake -- that knowing stuff is worthwhile without any further justification\n* Intellectual freedom -- scientists should follow their curiosity wherever it leads\n\nThese ideas are supported by many historical examples supporting our livelihoods:\n* Unpredictability of breakthroughs -- much transformative research came about from ideas and funding without any clear immediate benefits\n* Serendipity -- many breakthroughs have come about unexpectedly from research on wholly different questions\n* Foundational knowledge -- basic research creates the foundation upon which later critical innovations rely\n* Cultural value -- scientific knowledge is intrinsically valuable to humanity\n\nExamples of the above include:\n* Quantum mechanics has moved beyond theory to enable electronics and computation\n* Number theory was seemingly masturbatory mathematics until it became the underpinning of all computer security\n* Einstein's theory of relativity was interesting and revolutionized how we viewed the universe, but it didn't have immediate implications for our lives... until it became essential for GPS\n* Examples abound in the biological sciences, where our curiosity hundreds of years ago has informed germ theory, antibiotics, and all modern medicine today. \n* Game theory\n* Census data collection\n* Sociology of science\n* Kinsey's sex research\n* Social network science actually began in the 1930s but is now relevant to online communities and public health intervention\n\nI could go on and on.\n\nIt sounds like I'm saying we should fund all ideas anyone ever has. I am not. NIH, NSF, and all the other organizations mentioned in the post have (*HAD*) extremely rigorous review panels of experts who decide which ideas are worth anything and which ones to prioritize with limited funds. I also want to note something else often overlooked -- science is cheap. The labor (grad students) is cheap, and professors often forgo far better industry salaries to do research cheaply. Materials are often purchased on slim margins. The total scientific research expenses of the US pale compared to military and welfare expenses, yet they are critical to our economics, quality of life, and position in the world.\n\nBlocking research ideas for political or cultural reasons (a distaste for one field or another) harms us now and well into the future. The United States has enjoyed its place on the world stage mainly because of the science it funds. We have attracted the best and brightest for 100 years. Our universities educate the world, exporting our ideas, ways of thinking, and culture. The most lucrative industries come out of the US exclusively *because* we funded science, not because something has been intrinsically better about Americans.\n\n\\* Some of the above is outside my specific expertise and I would accept refinement and correction from other experts.",

Though the information does not cover the tax years at the center of an escalating battle between the Trump administration and Congress, it traces the most tumultuous chapter in a long business career ‚Äî an era of fevered acquisition and spectacular collapse.\n\nThe numbers show that in 1985, Mr. Trump reported losses of $46.1 million from his core businesses ‚Äî largely casinos, hotels and retail space in apartment buildings. They continued to lose money every year, totaling $1.17 billion in losses for the decade.\n\nIn fact, year after year, Mr. Trump appears to have lost more money than nearly any other individual American taxpayer, The Times found when it compared his results with detailed information the I.R.S. compiles on an annual sampling of high-income earners.

      "text": "No, it won't. We'll always have Conservatives because it's [all in the brain](https://www.livescience.com/13608-brain-political-ideology-liberal-conservative.html).\n\nIt seems that voters that lean Conservative have regions of the brain that are more sensitive to fear and disgust, have reduced brain capacity to handle uncertainty (not open to change), and tend to be very in-group loyal (outsiders are to be feared).\n\nPeople that lean Liberal are open to new experiences, view the whole human race as their \"in-group\", and tend to react to obstacles with problem-solving rather than a \"kill it with fire\" approach.\n\nThis is why the LGBT crowd and \"illegals\" are \"disgusting\" to Conservatives. They lament that Liberals are trying to let in foreigners (very threatening to white power folks), make gay sex \"normal\", and want to just change everything willy-nilly, with no thought to traditional values and existing power structures.\n\nThe in-group, the family, the people your leaders tell you to value are who you champion, even if they are greedy robber barons, polluters or pious, religious pedophiles. For example, the environment is championed by the Left, so it's of no consequence to you. The spotted owl is getting in the way of profits and power by your in-group? Not your concern, that's out-group stuff. Native Americans don't want a leaky oil pipeline through their lands? Maybe we should beat them, jail them and take that land, then maybe they'll learn not to mess with your in-group. Illegals are crossing the border for a chance at a better life? BUILD THAT WALL.\n\nFear and disgust are literally baked into their brains, and anyone who looks or acts differently is a threat. Unfortunately, you add in religion and now their way of life is sacred, and anyone who threatens that sacrosanct equilibrium is not just offending them, but offending God.\n\nOnce you have God in it, that means any shitty thing you do in defense of God is Right and Good, and therefore you're personally absolved of wrongdoing and are free to be as cruel and heartless as you choose to defend God, Country, and Family from the hordes of the unwashed masses, the cockroaches invading and infecting your pristine home.\n\nThere's a reason that White Supremacists love \"Camp of the Saints\", Stephen Miller's favorite book. It's so deliciously disgusting in its descriptions of the enemy (unwashed masses of brown, Indian people that have indiscriminate sex and literally eat feces) and features a righteous cleansing as a grande finale. You can also see the same trope in the very popular Christian book series \"Left Behind\", with vivid descriptions of murder and hellfire rained down upon the unbelievers.\n\nOnce you see it through their lens, all their actions are much easier to understand.\n\nPoliticians are humans, and so they also are subject to the same Conservative/Liberal leanings, and that's why we see sides taken naturally for the most part, and we see that reflected in the causes they champion.\n\nConservatives will be against immigration and helping the poor (they're poor, unwashed, disgusting bums breeding more open mouths that are a burden on the system), and they must stop the buttsex.\n\nLiberals will be for immigration and the poor because they need help, and they know that if you integrate them into society, they will become working partners in society. Liberals aren't disgusted by buttsex, because the buttsex is between consenting adults. We look for solutions to problems, and Conservatives look for a gun to murder the problems.\n\nNow, keep in mind that the spotlight and power of politics attract the most narcissistic and sociopathic individuals who are smart enough to know how to manipulate their voters and play to their fears and desires, so sometimes you have politicians that gravitate toward one side or the other because they view it as advantageous to their personal situation.\n\nThat's why many politicians on either side are simply opportunists, wolves clothed in the skins of the sheep they feel they can mimic and use to their advantage. Most politicians are easily swayed by money that serves either their personal interest in furthering their careers or serves their goals in shaping society for their in-groups, and sometimes it's a mix of both.\n\nOnce we understand the motivations of the politicians and the people that vote for them, it's easier to understand why someone could feel Trump is \"good\" by either serving the interests of their in-group (or themselves) or harming the out-groups they despise. It's fungible because both actions serve their needs.\n\nUnfortunately, if you are a person that cares about the U.S. Constitution, the rule of law and our future as a nation of all peoples no matter the color of their skin or their personal sexual preferences, then Conservatism may not be for you.\n\nEDIT: Wow, this really blew up. I've enjoyed the comments and I've tried to answer as many as possible.\n\nOne thing I'd like to clarify is that I don't feel as if people are \"born Conservative or Liberal\", that's just silly. As I said in this post, the study (and others like it) show evidence of how a person's leaning toward a Conservative or Liberal stance can sometimes be reflected in their brain scans.\n\nIf you're familiar with marketing techniques and how propagandists use their playbooks to manipulate people, it's easy to understand how these leanings can be exploited. Playing on fear and disgust is a tool, and in times of war, entire nations will de-humanize the \"other\" to make their citizens fear and loathe them.\n\nThe Right uses fear and loathing techniques to enrage their viewers about Liberals, and have been doing so since the late 80's. Reagan and the Republicans crafted a terrible plan back then, and we're seeing the gross end result today.\n\nIn 1987, Republicans killed the Fairness Doctrine, a law that stated that any media that ran a political opinion piece HAD to give equal time to the other viewpoint. This was no good for the Republicans, so they lobbied and killed that law. At the same time, they also lobbied and killed an FCC rule that forbade ownership of too many radio/tv stations and newspapers by any individual or company, and the areas they could operate in.\n\nHuge win for their plan.\n\nOnce those two obstacles were removed, wealthy media owners began buying up cheap AM radio stations (that were being killed by FM radio anyway), and groomed Rush Limbaugh to begin broadcasting during the morning and afternoon drivetime slots.\n\nThis was the beginning of a massive socio-political propaganda campaign that enjoyed plausible deniability of its existence. It was just a regular guy on the radio, but he had an agenda, and the agenda was to foment rage in male blue-collar and white-collar workers.\n\nEvery morning and every afternoon, Rush spewed hate about Liberals. They were the cause of all our ills, the destruction of the country and traditional values. He spewed racism and sexism and he made it funny sometimes, but it was always dark and poisonous.\n\nBut that was only radio, and tv was next. Enter Roger Ailes, Nixon's political groomer, who brought in Fox News, with the same rage-inducing hatred of Liberals and their destruction of American values.\n\nFast-forward 40+ years, and all those men listening and watching and then going home and ranting to their families, warning them about the Liberals, created this political toxicity we see today.\n\nIt spawned many, many similar right-wing pundits: Glenn Beck, Sean Hannity, Michelle Malkin, Mark Levin, Dennis Prager, Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly, Alex Jones, Laura Ingraham, Erick Erickson, Andrew Breitbart, etc, all telling us how Liberals were the only thing keeping America down. The Republicans planned and orchestrated it, and they manufactured a hell of a massive voting bloc. \n\nNow we see the end result of decades of targeted propaganda: the Trump voter.\n\nThe rage is so finely distilled, so pure and potent, that nothing can dissuade this voter from their support. No matter how Trump stumbles and reels, careening and crashing, bumbling and sputtering, he is their man.\n\nThere is nothing too cruel to inflict upon the Left. Children in cages? Serves them right for being brown, and not born in America. I could go on and on, but we're all very familiar with the daily abuses and norm shattering, the criminal revelations of this administration that are so normalized now that we can barely register each new low in America's history unfolding before us.\n\nSo here we are in this crazy timeline, because of the willingness of Conservatives to accept this propaganda as gospel because it came from their trusted source, their tribe.\n\nI don't know what to do about it, but I think it all starts with understanding why someone would accept such nonsense in the first place, and doing something about the crushing, ongoing firehose of Right-Wing propaganda.",

      "text": "> So we don't know why the disparity exists and we don't even need to, then what's the solution? \n\nI gave you a couple of examples and a couple of solutions. If there is a policy or a law or a system that's unfair, make it fair, or at least try to make it more fair than it was before. You seem to think I'm talking about individuals and individual choices, but the problem is so much bigger than that.\n\n>If the problem is racism then we should sure enact a policy that changes how people feel\n\nYou and I and everyone else reading this knows that laws and policies aren't going to change people's hearts. That doesn't mean we should give up on having fair, equitable and just systems. \n\nWe're never going to change the human heart so that domestic abuse and child abuse stop happening, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't have laws against it. You can't enact a policy that changes people's feelings about the LGBTQ community, but you can make discrimination illegal. You can't enact a policy that makes everyone love and respect animals, but you can punish animal cruelty. \n\n> because there is no way I am going to get people fired from their jobs and very potentially cause chaos in other areas because of incidents that are perpetuated by the media.\n\nAre you talking about SROs here? Look, when we finally outlaw conversion therapy for LGBTQ youth everywhere, that industry is going to go away and people are going to lose their jobs, and I'm 100% fine with that. Because their jobs involve harming and physically and mentally and emotionally torturing children \"for their own good,\" in the belief that this intervention is important and necessary and needed. Many of the people doing it honestly think of themselves as good, caring, loving people who are just trying to help the kids in their care. But the *facts* and the science and the psychology and everything we know from *reality* is that they are not helping, they're not effective, and the kids under their power would be better off without them. Do you see where I'm going with this?\n\nIt is a statistical fact that however nice one individual SRO may be -- the institution of putting a cop in schools and criminalizing normal teenage behavior *is* being unfairly applied to children and teens of color, even when they misbehave at the same rate as white kids, and it *is* harming those children and harming society. Do the research. \n\n> Don't be lazy and say \"we don't need to know, just screw them.\" That way is not how America works, that's cancel culture.\n\nMaking policy decisions based on reality and the best facts we have available to us isn't cancel culture. You have an anecdote, \"I knew a nice SRO once.\" But all the *data* collected from hundreds of thousands of schools and millions of incidents says that putting SROs in schools overwhelmingly harms kids, mostly black and Hispanic kids, by criminalizing normal teenage behavior, punishing them when white kids get away with the same stuff, traumatizing kids by arresting them, and sending them on the school-to-prison pipeline. It is a *system* that, on the whole is broken, and needs to be fixed.",

      "text": ">Yes I have. But you fail to recognize that I don‚Äôt consider evolution a science either. Both theories are based on unverifiable assumptions about the past. If we going to include one, lets include both.\n\nIt doesn't matter what you think. Evolution is a science. It can be proven wrong, and by eliminating every possibility of it being wrong, it is proven right.\n\n>In my presentation I used the FACT of the moon receding away from the earth at 4cm per year. My conclusion based on that fact is that the earth cannot be billions of years old. How is that not science?\n\nThat is not a fact. The moon is accelerating. Even if it was 4cm per year at the specific time I typed this, it wasn't 1 second ago and it won't be 1 second from now. It's speeding up, so saying \"it's receding at x cm per year\" is an entirely incorrect statement, because it doesn't factor in acceleration.\n\n>Actually creationism gives a theory that the geologic column and fossil record are the result of a worldwide flood. No other creation stories allow for a fully plausible explanation of the evidence left behind.\n\nWrong. In fact every single creation myth out there is developed based on what they see around them. It's how early civilizations explain things they don't understand. Science proves those explanations false. Just like it has been proven that no matter how deep, big, or fast a flood, it simply would not have created the results you are attributing in 40 days. It's an unscientific explanation, that goes off of false assumptions with how erosion and fossilization works. \n\n>Teaching any theory in science as fact should be illegal.\n\nThey don't, they teach about the facts and evidence and the conclusions of the theories, determined by rigorous scientific testing, not just baseless assumptions.\n\n>Teaching creation does not endorse a religion any more than teaching the history of the slave trade endorses slavery. \n\nYes it does. It is teaching that a religious belief, and only a religious belief, is a realistic theory for the origin of life. It is in no way scientific and is completely contradictory to all evidence, and is not a realistic theory, nor is it an accepted theory, not only by nearly all scientists, but also by nearly all christians. If you want to claim god created humans, you have to prove god's existence. In order to prove god's existence, you must come up with a model that would prove he didn't exist if false. Since this is impossible, creationism, and any religion based \"science\" is unfalsifiable, and therefore not testable, and therefore, not scientific. Evolution is a model which makes predictions, which if false, would prove evolution is false. This means it is testable, and therefore scientific. By the way those predictions have all been proven true.\n\n>Perhaps you can answer your own question here. How come it can be taught here not as fact but not in a science class?\n\nThis is a cultural study class. It's not saying any of these beliefs are realistic or unrealistic. It is simply stating that some people have these beliefs, as it is a study of that culture. Science classes are not about a study of culture, they are about presenting facts and teaching the scientific method. The scientific method states that a theory must be falsifiable to be scientific. If a theory is falsifiable, then it can be taught in science classes, whether or not that theory is correct. The teachings would then include any evidence and test results regarding that theory, and any conclusions.\n\n>We‚Äôve been down this whole debate several times. No need to go in depth here again. My argument is not in the evidence, it is in the interpretations.\n\nAnd that's simply not how science works\n\n>You nailed it! ‚ÄúIt depends on the circumstances‚Äù. Creationists believe in a 6-day creation period vs. billions of years. Creationists believe in a year-long catastrophic deluge of the earth vs. millions of years of burial in the fossil record. I agree with you that it depends on the circumstances.\n\nThe \"circumstances\" I was referring to in this section has nothing to do with belief, just facts.\n\n>You seem to miss that I acknowledged in my presentation that there were problems with the moon example. I used those problems to make my point that extrapolation fails.\n\nOf course it fails if you have the **entirely wrong equation**. Basic observation shows the moon is accelerating. Not factoring that into the equation is just plain stupid.\n\n>That‚Äôs not what Darwin said: ‚Äú‚Ä¶evidence of their former existence could be found ONLY amongst fossil remains.‚Äù The question I asked is why would some species be evolving and not others.\n\nYou don't seem to understand that quote. Notice it says \"former existence\". If humans evolved into human+, there is no former existence. Both exist simultaneously. Evolution is like a branching tree. When a mutation happens, it branches off from the existing species. More often then not, the original species will either die out or Incorporated the new mutation into its genome. However, that's not necessary. Both can live simultaneously. Evolution isn't a linear path. It has multiple branching paths. For example, a reason one ancestor species may survive alongside its further evolved descendant: Lets look at the human example again. Humans live on multiple continents. Lets say Australia becomes quarantined off from the rest of the world. Later, Australian humans mutate and develop new traits. Eventually these traits are enough to differentiate Australians from the rest of the humans. In Australia we now have human+, and in the rest of the world we still have humans.\n\n>You use the words ‚Äúproven‚Äù and ‚Äúfact‚Äù incorrectly. At the committee meeting yesterday, NO ONE, including the science professor from Purdue University described evolution as fact. No professional I've ever heard speak on the topic would. In fact the professor agreed that it is not fact and he does not use the word \"proven\" ever\n\nThose words can be used in several different ways. If you say evolution isn't proven, then you are also saying gravity isn't proven, and most other scientific theories. Evolution makes predictions about what should happen if evolution is false. We perform tests until we can eliminate every single one of these predictions. Usually, at this point, most people would say it's proven. However, we continue on. Evolution then makes predictions on what SHOULD happen if evolution is TRUE. We continue to perform tests, every single prediction is proven true. These are basic tests on how you prove or disprove a scientific theory, and under these tests evolution is proven true.\n\n>For future reference, you might want to rethink using a human evolving into a human as your example.\n\nI wasn't using evolution. I was talking about age. In age, we must go through every year of life. We can't just jump from child to adult. In evolution, we must go through thousands of intermediate stages. We can't just jump from Homo Habilis to Homo Sapien. \n\n> I don‚Äôt dispute it because I don‚Äôt understand it. The logic makes sense, but that doesn‚Äôt mean the evidence aligns.\n\nexcept it does\n\n>Ah yes, the flu example. I believe I‚Äôve talked with you about this before. The flu virus adapts. Creationists believe in adaptation.\n\nAdaptation **IS** evolution. They are the same exact thing.\n\n>What the flu virus does not do is change into a fish or a bird or a monkey.\n\nOf course it doesn't, that's **NOT** how evolution works. Did you just ignore the above example? Nothing jumps from one species to the next, there are thousands, sometimes millions of intermediate generations. However, the flu has evolved. We used to just have the regular flu. Now we have the bird flu, the swine flu, etc. These are not the same species. These are new species, adapted and evolved from its predecessor. The bird flu and swine flu are not the same species simply because they have a similar name. If there were other intelligent beings living on this earth while humans evolved from their predecessors, we might be called \"bald chimps\". That doesn't mean we're the same species as the other chimps.\n\n>Depth of the fossils confirm it only if you believe the fossils were buried over long periods of time.\n\nNo, they confirm it regardless of what you believe about how they were buried. If you believe they were all buried nearly instantaneously, there would be no progression based on depth of dig. The deeper you dig, the more humans look like apes. The depth argument simply shows a natural progression from the fossils which are assumed to be human ancestors to modern human fossils. The progression is natural whether you believe in it or not because of the way the bones were found. If it was just dig depth, that wouldn't be enough to claim their ages. However, then we perform dating methods, which **100% confirm** what the fossil depth tells us. The deeper you dig, the older the sample, and the dating methods can tell us exactly how old the samples are, which again, also completely confirms the model found by DNA analysis.\n\n>Close matching DNA does not prove a common ancestor any more than it proves a common designer.\n\nAgain, you ignore the rest of the paragraph. It isn't simply about one match. It's about comparing the **entire** animal kingdom. If it was simply a common designer, and not evolution, there would not be any natural family tree formed by DNA comparison throughout the entire animal kingdom. It would just look like random noise, and more animals would actually likely have closer matching DNA than they do now (not everything is so close like humans and chimps).\n\n>The fossils found in the geologic column from bottom to top actually represent perfectly what we would expect to see if waters enveloped creatures across the world in the days of the flood\n\nNo they don't. Animals would be found bottom to top, yes, but there would be no natural progression in the physical characteristics of the fossils. There is.",

However I find that, in many cases, they are predisposed to extreme skepticism because scientists have been making \"doom and gloom\" predictions about the climate for most of their lives. To them, climate scientists are the \"boy who cried wolf\".\n\nMy question is, what data exists today that can be used to convince these people that our understanding is greater than what it used to be when those older predictions were made? How can their skeptical outlook on climate science be changed after so many years of overly dramatic predictions?",

      "text": "The first step is to think about your own goal for this conversation. What are you hoping to get out of the conversation, and what are you hoping the person you are talking with will do as a result of the conversation? Do you want that person to connect the global issue of climate change to impacts happening in their own community? To take a particular action, like supporting policies to reduce emissions? To engage their own friends and family in conversations about climate change? Thinking about these goals can help you better frame the conversations that you have.\n\nNext, the medium and the people you are talking with matters. Are these people that you know and have a connection with (friends, family, community members) or people that you've just encountered? Are you having this conversation face-to-face or via a platform like Twitter? What do you have in common with the people that you are talking with, and how can you build connections with them? Building those connections requires having a conversation, including listening to the other person's concerns and questions.\n\nOnce you've thought about your goals and who it is you are talking with, then it is time to move on to what to actually say. Climate change is a scary topic, and acknowledging that as a part of the conversation is important - and much more effective than just responding with a lot of data about climate. As Katharine Hayhoe puts it in an editorial in *Science (*[https://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6392/943](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6392/943)): \"If scientists describe the daunting challenge of climate change but can't offer an engaging solution, then people's natural defense mechanism is to disassociate from the reality of the problem. That's why changing minds also requires providing practical, viable, and attractive solutions that someone can get excited about... By connecting our heads to our hearts, we all can talk about‚Äîand tackle‚Äîthe problem of climate change together.\"\n\nYou might think about a few key points you can keep in your back pocket for these conversations - these might be \"reality, risk, response\" ([https://whatweknow.aaas.org](https://whatweknow.aaas.org)), \"simple, serious, solvable\" ([http://simpleserioussolvable.org/](http://simpleserioussolvable.org/)), or something else that helps you orient your discussion. Using what you know about your audience and what you learn from them as a part of the conversation, you can choose specific examples that might work best for the situation.\n\nHere are a few resources that you might want to use in discussions:\n\n* Warming Stripes ([https://showyourstripes.info/](https://showyourstripes.info/)):  visual representations of the change in temperature as measured in countries, states, and more over the past 100+ years \n* Climate Spirals ([http://www.climate-lab-book.ac.uk/spirals/](http://www.climate-lab-book.ac.uk/spirals/)): animations of temperature changes, Arctic sea ice volume, carbon dioxide concentrations, and more\n* Frequently Asked Questions from the Fourth National Climate Assessment ([https://nca2018.globalchange.gov/chapter/appendix-5/](https://nca2018.globalchange.gov/chapter/appendix-5/)): how do we know the Earth is warming, why is recent climate change different from the past, etc.\n* How We Respond ([https://howwerespond.aaas.org](https://howwerespond.aaas.org)): What communities across the US are doing to respond to climate impacts",

So the arguments for skeptics aren't only about if climate change is real or not, but also what should the scale of response be, and how effective will that response be.\nAlso, to add to your point, predictions have been all over the place in the past. It's unreasonable in my opinion to expect everyone to believe current predictions given the history. What should be done is frame the current information in a way that is compelling and honest, while also being transparent in areas where data is still unclear. When a skeptic sees any type of claim that is absolute, such as \"in 15 years this will happen\", they tend to dismiss it as hysteria. Whereas presenting a claim as \"current data trends indicate that in 15 years it will be highly probable\", etc., will inform those who are skeptical while not turning them away, allowing them to make up their own minds.\nTLDR; Be respectful of people's skepticism and communicate in ways that aim to inform, not persuade.",

      "text": ">reveals that communities of color have almost 40% fewer healthcare establishments than majority-white areas.  For example, in Houston, majority-white communities have 27 healthcare facilities for every 100,000 people while majority-black communities have just 5 facilities for every 100,000 people\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs that accounting for age? The average age for blacks is less than half that of the average age of whites. Older people will consume more healthcare and at greater cost. People over 65 consume so much more healthcare 1/3 of all healthcare dollars are spent on them. One might be tempted to say blacks have a lower age because fewer survive to old age due to inadequate care, which is likely part of it, but then homicide is the \\*number 4 killer\\* of blacks, when it doesn't even crack the top ten for whites. The top 3 killers of each have similar percentages of deaths due to it(heart disease, cancer, unintentional injuries), while a higher percentage of deaths from lower respiratory diseases is among than whites than blacks-conversely we see a higher percentage of deaths from diabetes from blacks than whites. These can arguably be attributed to lifestyles, as whites are more likely to smoke and blacks are more likely to have a diet conducive to getting diabetes.   \n\n\n\\> >Racial inequality is so baked into our society that even algorithmic systems designed to improve the quality of healthcare [generate bias against black patients](https://news.uchicago.edu/story/health-care-prediction-algorithm-biased-against-black-patients-study-finds). \n\nThe age question comes up again, but I tried to look into the study to see how they measured \"similar health level\" as the bias is claimed to be due to risk being based on cost of healthcare(hence the age concern), but it is behind a paywall. Could you elaborate on this study and its methodology?  \n\n\n\\> Math, or Biology, or the [lack of diversity](https://whyy.org/articles/more-than-half-of-pa-public-schools-do-not-have-a-teacher-of-color/) among educators and administrative officials.  However, if we want all children to reach their potential, we cannot turn a blind eye to the major drivers of  inequality.   \n\n\nPerhaps we should examine what percent of people actually \\*become\\* teachers. People are not random events. For all manner of reasons including cultural ones, you don't see a uniform distribution of career aspirations. We don't see as many Asian majoring in public administration or political science as we do engineers and scientists either, so it would stand to reason that those choosing a career in education would also be influenced by those factors.   \n\n\nOne can argue the disparity in educational attainment(even though blacks are slightly overrepresented in college, at least among undergrads), but that doesn't change the fact that of those \\*who do\\* get higher education also have a disparity in their career choices.  \n\n\nThis is before considering the value of diversity itself, where while blacks are underrepresented among STEM PhDs, 1/3 of black STEM PhDs were earned at HBCUs, indicating that groups may be \\*self segregating\\* as they prefer areas that align more culturally with their own sensibilities and priorities. To what extent segregation is due to one's own volition or structural biases remains unclear, but we cannot simply assume any disparity of result must be due to unfair biases.",

Funding helps, but the bigger difference maker is parental income due to the physical stability it provides (consistent food and place to sleep), the increased availability of parental presence, the ability to afford interventions (academic/behavioral), the average vocabulary and reading levels of the parents, the access to immediate medical/dental care, and the wider variety career/personal opportunities these parents provide.\n\nThe schools you're referring to aren't successful because they're funded more. They're successful because they students have more of their needs met outside the classroom. Fair school funding helps mitigate these to a certain extent which is why the property tax funding is problematic, but income inequality is the bigger problem at hand.",

      "text": "I think when you are thinking about evolution you are thinking long term, such as there were australopithecines, then early Homo and eventually us, but remember this is over millions of years. While evolution speed can change at different rates, evolution is not just long term. The fact you are alive today shows a product of evolution. The reason you might not see these huge changes is that other mechanisms are at play, for instance genetic drift. Genetic drift is the change of allele frequencies within a population due to chance. The larger the population the less effect genetic drift has as a whole.\n\nBut there still will be effects. I think recently it was found that the number of babies born by caesarean has increased. This is an example as in the past mothers with a small pelvis or babies with too large a head would die, meaning that there was less chance of these genes being passed on. However, with modern science, those in an industrialised society are less likely to die and therefore increase these alleles within the population. \n\nAs for predictions, I wonder if certain alleles will be lost in certain less industrialised societies as globalisation expands. And maybe in industrialised societies, modern medicine may allow for more detrimental alleles to increase if we can prevent the outcome. Since women are having children later in general (western), we may also see a general trend to living very slightly longer. As for the species as a whole, we've been in an inter-glacial for quite some time, so dependent on how our technology can increase to possible weather changes may see some effects, but we're very cultural animals so there is always a gene-culture co-evolution going on.\n\nPs not part of the AMA, just have a BSc and MSc in human evolution and is going on to PhD so I thought I'd add some insights. Also just as a note, binomial names such as \"Homo sapiens\" should always be capitalised on the genus, and italicised (obs hard on mobile) where possible.",

I loved flipping rocks to find insects and searching out bird nests in trees.  In high school, I focused on Biology classes (taking extra credit whenever it was offered).  Early in my university career I contacted a professor that studied the evolution of parental care in birds and asked to join his research team.  I started out at a small university on the Canadian prairies and after publishing a few papers and completing a masters, I applied to complete my PhD at my dream lab here at Harvard.   \n\nI would recommend that you continue to pursue what interests you most!   You are already way ahead of the curve if you know the field that you‚Äôre excited about in 6th grade.  There is so much available now online, so read whenever you can (e.g., science blogs, science magazines, and review articles when you‚Äôre ready for them).  Reaching out to researchers at a local university would be my next big suggestion.  Perhaps they can help advise you on a science fair project or help you get started with some basic research in the next few years.  Join Science teams and clubs when you get to secondary school (or start them if they don‚Äôt exist).  Good luck on your journey and make sure that you‚Äôre always having fun along the way!\n\n- Phil",

Organisms rely on extracting negentropy from the universe, and the amount of available/useful negentropy is limited, which suggests that in the long run, there is always going to be a scarcity of usable habitats. This idea has for instance been captured by Liu Cixin (The Three-Body Problem; The Dark Forest): Perhaps the universe is so quiet because every intelligent species understands that they are going to be wiped out by technologically superior species if they announce the existence of their habitat. I very much love the philosophical/evolutionary science fiction contributions of Stanislav Lem (Star Diaries, Fiasco, Summa Technologiae, His Master's Voice), Arkadi and Boris Strugazki (Roadside Picknick, Experiment), Vernor Vinge (Deepness in the Sky, Fire Upon the Deep), and about everything from Greg Egan (e.g., Permutation City, Diaspora). Science fiction has had a huge influence on many scientists' careers, and often the authors are actually scientists or philosophers (like Egan or Lem) that use the medium to express their insights and theories.",

      "text": "It is true that many (especially non-experts) give \"just-so\" evolutionary explanations. And this isn't good science (albeit sometimes a good first step). \n\nAs with any scientific explanation, you want to make sure the theory fits the empirical world \"like a hand to a glove.\" Meaning, with very moderate assumption it takes a bunch of otherwise puzzling facts and fits them well. \n\nBut of course with enough assumptions you can fit any facts, so the key is to make sure you get a lot of bang for your buck. That is, your assumptions should be a lot less complicated than the phenomena you are trying to explain. \n\nLastly, the theory needs to be falsifiable. That is, there needs to be conceivable evidence (ideally even predicted by alternative theories) that would go \"the other direction.\"\n\nTrivers' explanation for sex differences fits the above criteria quite well. He wondered why in so many species (but not all) males are so different from females. They tend to be more aggressive, more risk taking, have shorter life spans, get jealous, fight, ... why? He argued that males, typically invest less in parenting, giving them larger benefits from more mating opportunities relative to females. Everything else seems to follow from there. His argument 1) explained a lot that was otherwise hard to explain 2) took very mild assumptions 3) and is falsifiable. To see the latter: notice that it concretely predicts that in species where males do a larger share of the parenting there should be a reversal in standard sex differences, which has been confirmed. And the size of the sex gap in parenting should correlate with other sex differences, which has also been very well documented (Eg in closely related deer species). Notice that for both of these predictions, the data could have gone the other way. \n\n-Moshe Hoffman",

      "text": "Don't know if this is what you're talking about, but when I talk about the layman's term \"evolution\" I usually get down into the two more technical terms \"natural selection\" and \"universal common descent\".\n\nThe first is what Alison describes in her second paragraph, and is pretty much mathematically provable for organisms that work the way life on earth works.  It leads to mostly small changes at a time (because large changes are both statistically rarer and much more likely to harm the organism).  However, these small changes can add up over time, and it's purely subjective to decide whether a bunch of accumulated changes are \"micro\" or \"macro\".  There's a rough limit to how *fast* changes occur, but there's no inherent limit on how many different changes natural selection can make.\n\nPopulation genetics does draw a distinction in sexually reproducing organisms between interbreeding or reproductively separated groups, but it's totally possible for a single and continuously interbreeding population to change radically over a long enough period of time, and the question of how \"macro\" that effect is, or when that population of organisms became a different species, is all in the eye of a beholder.  There's no point you can draw a cut-off line and say it's one species on one side and one on the other.  Any two adjacent organisms on the spectrum are literally parent and child.  But the original type of organism is long gone, and the ones you've ended up with don't look anything like it.\n\nConversely, you could have a group of interbreeding organisms which just happens to get split into two near-identical but reproductively isolated populations (say, by a natural disaster); and which, due to being caught in local optima of their fitness landscapes, don't end up *looking* very different from each other even after a long period of time (though you could still detect this by measuring [random mutations that had occurred differently between the different groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_clock)).  In such a situation, it's entirely possible that the two species might look superficially identical, but be unable to produce viable offspring when interbred.  Do we call these two groups the same species, or a different one?  Again, it's a pretty subjective call.\n\nGiven the above, I'm sure you can see that it's hard to even get a clear idea of how \"macro\" changes in natural selection would look different from any other ones.  So let me go on to the second technical term, \"universal common descent\", because I think it has a better chance of guaranteeing that we capture what you're looking for in terms of \"macro\" effects.  Universal common descent (UCD) is the observed fact that all known forms of life on earth (and that's all we have to go on for now!) share a single tree of ancestry.  Pick any two organisms on the planet, and they are related!  if you trace their heredity back step by step you would eventually arrive at a single place they both descended from.  I assume that this definitely qualifies as \"macro\" enough for you?  One original replicating organism eventually changing into the incredible array of different organisms we see today?\n\nBecause it's possible to imagine natural selection simply acting on a diverse population of otherwise unrelated organisms, UCD makes unique and specific predictions that go beyond just the existence of a modifying force like natural selection.  And testable predictions are how we get evidence for something being true in the first place.  The reason scientists believe in UCD *as well*, and not just natural selection *alone*, is because these unique and specific predictions are overwhelmingly observed to be true when we check them, providing an enormous level of evidence to support that belief.  Lots of them are super easy to figure out and observe for yourself, so I encourage you to try it.  But I'll give you a few to start.\n\nFirst, the number one prediction of UCD is that, if all organisms have descended from a single ancestor, all organisms should share an inheritance mechanism.  In other words, universal common descent predicts that every living thing should have DNA/RNA.  Nowadays we take this information for granted, but UCD predicted this before we even knew what DNA was, which is pretty impressive!  New species are still being discovered all the time, and we have yet to discover a single one that doesn't use DNA/RNA.  That's crazy unlikely for them all to use the exact same inheritance mechanism if they didn't inherit it from the same place.\n\nNext, speaking of DNA, what's a common technique used all the time to check if two people are related?  DNA testing!  It's pretty simple to realise that if natural selection is only changing DNA very slowly, then the amount of difference between the DNA of two organisms is a rough approximation for how closely related they are.  So we can do the same testing on all life that we do on human families, with the same kind of math, to check if all life on earth is *actually* related.  Even though we only learned to sequence DNA in [the 1970s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing#Sequencing_of_full_genomes), and Darwin detailed universal common descent in the 1850s, the results match perfectly!  Some people have tried to argue, by the way, that this is because there are only so many ways to do things, or that this also fits the picture of a \"design family\".  But neither claim is compatible with what we observe.  For example, [ERV's are the remnants of an ancestor's viral infections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogenous_retrovirus) so there should be absolutely no reason to have these in the exact same place of two different organism's genomes unless they share a common ancestor who was infected.  These, and other types of \"gene fossils\" that aren't protected by natural selection (if these parts mutate it doesn't put the organism at a disadvantage) exhibit a specific \"dying out\" pattern that show us how closely two organisms are related.  Even in human relatedness testing [this is the stuff we mostly rely on](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noncoding_DNA#Forensic_anthropology), so the analogy here really is appropriate!  For reference, estimates of the amount that matters enough to be protected are somewhere around [8%-20% in humans](http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1004525).  *Most* of the DNA evidence for different species sharing common ancestry is specifically NOT about what makes the organisms work.  That makes this information being shared across species *very* strong evidence for UCD.\n\nAnd finally, another easy one is that UCD imposes *geographical* constraints on where we can find closely related species (as defined by DNA testing, for example).  After all, if all organisms had to physically get from one place where a common ancestor was to where they are now, then (especially for things like land animals that can't fly or swim well) we will often find clumps of related species stuck in specific geographic areas.  Why does Australia have a ridiculously wide range of marsupials that we don't find anywhere else?  Simple, the common ancestor they evolved from was already *in* Australia.  They couldn't *get* anywhere else.  It was actually the geographical hints that helped convince Darwin of UCD in the first place, because they are really strong.  Why on earth would it have to be the case that animals filling very different roles in the ecosystem are physically located with the other ones that have pouches?  There's no Australia-specific advantage to having a pouch.  Without UCD, this doesn't make any sense.  So things like this really made Darwin ask how that sort of thing kept happening wherever he travelled, and were one of the things that tipped him off to evolution.\n\nBut today, we can do something even cooler than just noticing the weird pattern.  The only marsupials I personally know of outside of Australia are the possums of the Americas.  But based on that geographic separation alone, combined with my knowledge of UCD, I can confidently predict that American possums will be more genetically distant from the Australian marsupials than the Australian marsupials are from each other.  Keep in mind that there are a *lot* of very different Australian marsupials who don't at all interbreed with each other, so this is a really ballsy claim to make based *only* on geography.  I'm saying that even a really possumy-looking marsupial in Australia will be a \"closer cousin\" to the kangaroo and the koala than it will be to the American possumy-looking ones.  I don't even know if this sequencing has actually been done yet--I didn't look it up before making this prediction.  But I know, based on geography alone, that that's how it will come out.  How could I possibly make that kind of prediction?  Simple, it's because I know about UCD.  And just like I did here, you can do this a hundred more times with your own examples where you don't look up the answer until you've used UCD to make the prediction.  UCD will be right every time.  There's just no way that this could keep happening by coincidence unless UCD were actually true.\n\nWell, as much fun as this is (and I could literally keep doing this for ages, UCD is one of the easiest to test facts in all of biology), I better leave it at that so this post doesn't get too long.  But needless to say, the experimental evidence for UCD is overwhelming.  And if all organisms really did evolve from a single ancestor, then that's about as macro as I think evolution can possibly get!  Hope this was helpful :)\n\n**Note:** I slightly oversimplify in some of the above, ask for more details if you care.  But (barring mistakes that I'm sure /r/science can catch!) everything I describe as strong evidence still works out to strong evidence on deeper examination, despite the details I'm skipping for the sake of readability.",

However, studies show that we lose BIPOC at pretty much every stage in formal education. I would argue that it actually starts well before high school degrees. There is a strong correlation between early learning opportunities and experiences (e.g., teacher-student relationship, access of rigorous curriculum, placement in accelerated/gifted programs), and later outcomes that matter for whether students decide to pursue careers in STEM (e.g., advanced math and science course taking in middle and high school, math and science identity and interest, access to STEM enrichment programs, performance on standardized tests) amongst other things. In fact, my own love for math was kindled by my third grade teacher, Mrs. Walker, and flourished because of the opportunities she facilitated for me.\n\nNot surprisingly, my colleagues and I find that these experiences help explain why Black undergraduate students leave STEM fields at higher rates. But we also find that [Black students leave STEM majors at significantly higher rates](https://www.higheredtoday.org/2019/03/04/study-examines-stem-programs-distinctive-racial-persistence-gaps/) even after we account for students and school characteristics, including academic preparation.

I also think it's the less favorable financial outlook of the pure sciences that discourage POCs. I think the financials are a big part. \n\nTo answer your second question, I would recommend \"selling\" to POC students a higher degree in a pure science is both easier to pay for than they think and it leads to a decent salary. If that's true, of course. Grad school is expensive, but if students knew about the stipends, scholarships, or fellowships available that's convincing. For employment, showing examples of jobs and expected salaries would be helpful.",

I checked for opportunities through work and the local university but I didn't find much other than food banks and habitat for humanity opportunities. I tried reaching out to a couple local organizations and volunteer opportunities earlier this year, but most of them were focused on elementary kids which was great, but I feel like I have something I can provide that would be more appreciated by older students. The situation with the pandemic has complicated me finding any good opportunities.",

      "text": "ok, so lots of other people provided you with good sources, but I want to point out that you should not be looking at \"the last 17 years,\" but rather further back in the past... 17 years ago was an anomalously warm year because of a really strong El Nino in the Pacific (~1998) so if you start your trend line at 17 years ago when it was one of the warmest years on record, you're going to obscure the long-term warming trend.\n\n It's like if you make the starting point in the middle of the summer, and then by autumn you point to it and say \"look, global temperatures are dropping! Therefore climate change is wrong\" when really you're just looking at the noise in the data, and not the long-term trend of changing averages. When politicians like Ted Cruz want to focus on only the last 17 years, they are knowingly being deceitful and cherry picking their data. \n\nAlso,I think that the [rising concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere](http://i.livescience.com/images/i/000/039/718/i02/keeling-carbon-dioxide.png?1367519267) are a clearer indication of climate change than temperature, since there's less noise and variability, it's an undeniably upward trend. By measuring CO2 trapped in bubbles in old ice, we can reconstruct past CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere, and the human impact is clear. If human activity can change the composition and chemistry of the Earth's atmosphere (and oceans, CO2 causes acidification in water) and it's clearly measurable, then the idea that we can affect climate as well is not all that far-fetched",

      "text": "There are four types of droughts, a) Meteorological drought; b) Agricultural drought; c) Hydrological drought; and d) Socioeconomic drought. For meteorological drought that is mostly related to amount of rainfall, and with the skills of current climate models and weather models, it could be predicted with fair accuracy. The agricultural drought evolves from meteorological drought. The agricultural drought is mostly the reserves of moisture/water in the soil layers especially, rootzone. This water is accessible to plants. Depletion of this water leads to agricultural drought. Therefore agricultural drought depends on the skills of predictions of meteorological drought and the type of crop grown in the region. Long spell of meteorological drought leads to hydrological drought because the flow in the rivers and creeks (base flow) stops due to receding water table and that could endanger water supply, and survival of many aquatic species and plants that depends on flow of river and creeks. Finally the socioeconomic drought that hit humans in many ways because of all the above mentioned droughts. The prediction of droughts therefore starts with predictions of rainfall and how well we do with this prediction, and the skills of drought prediction entirely depends on that. In my point of view, with current rate of improvement in model physics and remote sensing data the rainfall prediction will become better and the drought prediction skills with improve.\nIn coming years, with increasing human population and demand for more resources, we will also greatly feel the worsening impact of droughts. Hopefully, the predictions will improve and the human society as whole will mend ways to tackle future droughts. ---- Narendra (NASA-JPL)",

What are your thoughts on nebula genomics business model? I am skeptical that it increases donor interaction with their data, I am concerned that participants in their program can see have their data used in a predatory manner. Although it is an 'anonymous' program genotype-phenotype relationships are important, companies may want more interaction with the owner of the DNA. Interactions that cannot be anonymous.",

      "text": "Hi everyone, thanks for taking the time to have a discussion about this. I am a 4th year Ph.D. student in the field of pharmaceutical sciences and am nearing the end of my graduate career. I am very grateful there are skilled minds such as yourselves who are also concerned with the growing industrialization of genetic data.\n\nOver the past several years, I have had a growing concern for where our country is headed with regard to privacy of genetic information. As we move further into the technological age, information is becoming far more valuable than it's weight in gold. Specifically, issues with this first occurred with the monitoring, collection, and sale of private information (such as name, address, gender, age, etc...) as well as information about one's lifestyle and habits (browsing information online, search engine queries, online purchase, what shows you watch, your hobbies, etc..).\n\nMy main concern here is that computational and industrial advancements in the processing of genetic data have essentially brought it to the same playing field as these other types of personal data I just described. However as I'm sure you all know, genetic data is MUCH, MUCH more valuable, powerful, and *abusable* than just your name or hobbies. As we continue to gain more and more understanding of the functionality of our own genomes (i.e. can we tie genetic signatures to ethic origins? To sexual orientation? To personality?) While these may seem unlikely **now,** I think it's not at all unreasonable to think that we will be able to discern these traits and more in the upcoming decades. As such, this information may be some of the most valuable that any one entity could obtain. Within our capitalist democracy, private interests have shown that they have a LOT to gain by collecting, using/and or selling our personal data. Facebook was one of the first exposures of this gross misuse and collection of data. There was huge backlash, but ultimately I have not seen anywhere close to enough legislation to prevent this from continuing to happen. There are countless websites, browser extensions, even hardware that STILL will collect and sell your data \"technically\" with your permission by agreeing to their absurdly long privacy protection statements. Sometimes it feels like you need a law degree just to understand what you're agreeing to. The way things are going, will you need a law degree and an understanding of advanced genetics, too? Even now, I have to run a VPN, cookies deleting programs, script blockers, and Adblockers just to be able to SOMEWHAT avoid the information of my habits being processed and sold.\n\nThe only solution I have heard proposed to limiting the ability of private industries from collecting and using our data is through legislative processes. Creating laws to protect the consumer. While I know there are some in place, they seem to be flimsy and rather easy to subvert through these kinds of privacy statements that trick you into agreeing to something you probably wouldn't agree to if you knew what it truly was you were agreeing to. Furthermore, and what I see as ***the biggest issue*** is that it is no secret whatsoever that money speaks MUCH louder than the voices of the public. Let's acknowledge lobbying for what it truly is- bribery. Private interests have MUCH more influence over legislation that the populous within our capitalist society. As it has been shown over the past decade, these private interests can and will abuse and misuse your personal information for monetary gain. This becomes further exacerbated by the monopolization of the technological private sector. How many companies now are owned by Google, Amazon, or Facebook? These are MASSIVE and extremely wealthy entities that, as I have mentioned, have a LOT to gain from having your personal info.\n\nNow when we step back and remember that genetic information is *exponentially* more powerful and dangerous when abused, I ask you this- **What is stopping private interests from monetarily influencing legislation that would protect our genetic data?????** I can only imagine how much money there is to gain by knowing the genetic makeup of your consumer. As i had mentioned, what if they knew through your genetic signature that you were predisposed to obesity, and thus sent customized adds to you for diet pills? Or the opposite, for new McDonalds deals? How about if they could tell your sexual preference, or your hereditary/ethnic backgrounds?\n\nAs I'm sure you are all aware, there is something very disturbing going on in parts of China where certain Muslims are having their genetic information forcibly collected and heavily monitored. Is this really that different functionally from how our private data is constantly being breached and sold? The digitization and industrialization of a people's faith or ethnicity can be a **very dangerous thing**, with one of the more early and horrific examples being the holocaust. Could you imagine what the Nazi regime would've done if today's genetic technology was available to them? What is there to stop similar bad actors from doing it now?\n\n([https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/business/china-xinjiang-uighur-dna-thermo-fisher.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/business/china-xinjiang-uighur-dna-thermo-fisher.html))\n\nWe are in an age of exponential scientific and technological advancement, and our sociopolitical environment is NOT equipped to act in the best interest of the American people no matter how I seem to look at it. I'm sorry for such a long question, but I feel as though as a scientific community we should have considered these possibilities and asked these questions at least two decades ago. And as such, 20 years form now, what questions regarding the industrialization of genetic information should we be addressing *now?*\n\nPlease share your thoughts if you happen to come across this comment, and again thank you all so much for your time and the work you all do.",

This raises a few questions for me: Does this mean that doctors/ hospitals are going to keep a profile of our genetics? If treatment tailored to your genetics does turn out to be substantially better, will insurance companies increase prices for those unwilling to share their genetic code? Could those insurance companies then sell our genetic code to advertising agencies, or keep a profile of us after we‚Äôve stopped using their service? This is a serious issue I truly don‚Äôt think many people have considered. Facebook sells all our data to advertising companies and makes billions, and that‚Äôs just data from whatever we happen to click on when we use Facebook; imagine the monetary temptation to misuse the genetic profiles of two billion people (Facebooks active number of users). I see that a select minority of people stand to benefit from the buying and selling of genetic data, while the rest of us get put between a hammer and an anvil. Either we sell/give out our genetic code, which, in all probability will be used against us by one company or a another; Or we refuse, in which case life gets more and more difficult for us, as services begin to rely more and more on our genetics. As an example of this, imagine trying to buy car insurance in this new world of genetics. Already we have to give up a host of information about ourselves, anyone who has ever had to buy car insurance knows what I‚Äôm taking about. Imagine if in addition to that, it asked for your genetic code? All the predictions they will be able to make will be invaluable, so invaluable that they may simply deny your service altogether if you refuse to comply. Banks may do the same with loans and home mortgages, and while there may be a law against genetic discrimination in hiring, there is no such law (that I am aware of) for selecting students at university. I suppose if there‚Äôs a summary of my argument here it‚Äôs that our genetic code should never be something that is sold. It is not enough that my genetic code should belong to me by right, it should be a GUARANTEE that it cannot be used against me by anyone or anything.",

I have a great job, live in a country with universal health care (Israel), and know enough about genetics to fight claims. In fact, had we lived 70 years ago in Europe, I would have not shared my genome publicly as an Ashkenazi Jew. \n\nOur job as a society is to build regulatory and technological framework that will enable people to share their genetic data without fear. Please remember what is at stake: without people who volunteer to share genetic data, science cannot conduct large scale studies to understand the biological basis of various maladies. We are all going to be sick at some point in our life and we all want the best medical care. Genetic information leads to better medicine and therefore it is paramount to construct the framework to safely share it.",

If you recall, the police cannot identify the DNA of Vincent Freeman (Ethan Hawke) because he is not in their database. Today, with investigative genetic genealogy, the police would have no problem to identify him in a few days of work.\n\nOn the other hand, recent studies in genetics have shown how useless is genetic data to predict many types of traits compared to other types of data. For example, GATTACA has this amazing scene of predicting Vincent's birth where the doctor predicts that he will live to age of ~30 yrs based on his genetics. We know today that it is impossible to predict your life span from genetic data. Genetics explains only 5yrs on average of the differences in life span between individuals. And we know that genetic predictions can be modulated via environmental factors. \n\nPlease bear in mind that other types of data, such as social media accounts, your google searches, or simply which school you attend, predict far better future performance in many jobs. Employers already use these proxies whether we like it or not...",

      "text": "Psychologist here. Great questions. I work at a larger research institute somewhere between Human Factors and very basic cognitive psychology, my colleagues are mainly computer scientists and engineers. But of course I have friends working in therapy, marketing, neuro science etc. \n\n*Short answer*: We don't know.\n\nQuestion 1: Psychology, as I experience it, is very fragmented. You'd have to first define if you talk about academic psychology, and/or what people actually do once they are on their own. There are several divides between people who have some degree as psychologists. One of the greatest is the question of how much Psychology should be formalized. Personally, I vote for 'as much as possible', wich does require advanced mathematical models of cognition. Here, psychologists are on the forefront of shaping modern statistics (e.g. [this guy](http://www.ejwagenmakers.com/)), trying to figure out what 'evidence' in behavioral experiments actually is, what it means, and how we can incorporate this knowledge into formalized theories. These theories can be sets of equations describing e.g. vision ([here's one researcher who is very active in that field](http://www.uni-ulm.de/in/neuroinformatik/mitarbeiter/h-neumann.html)), but they can also be software which simulates more complex cognitive functions (e.g. [ACT-R](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT-R)). I regard these efforts to be the best modern psychology has to offer, because with that we have the chance to develop theories that will outlast the day and allow for quantitative predictions of individual behavior. But many psychologists disagree here, stating that human behavior is either too complex or fundamentally not suited to be described with formalized methods. This camp does have a few good arguments, and I agree that logic may not sufficient to capture cognition. But I have yet to see compelling evidence that *any* formalization effort is useless, and what the alternative should be.\n\nQuestion 2: Psychology offers *potential* useful value to other disciplines. I believe the best we have to offer is a sound methodology. We have over 100 years experience in setting up experiments, measuring behavior etc. But we have trouble exporting this knowledge, partially due to the lack of good theories. This is the one issue really hindering Psychology's advancement. Very often, psychologists are satisfied having shown an unspecified effect, without a proper explanation of that effect. If you then try to explain the significance of a finding, the other person has to understand the specific experimental setup, plus the effect may not be generalizable. We simply don't know the transferability of a given theory / finding. Your example is re-inforcement learning and machine learning. I'm not sure about that. I'm not aware of a truely formalized account of re-inforcement learning, hence it's be hard to transfer this to machine learning. I suspect a deeper connection due to basic properties of how information is processed, but we are far from understanding such a deep connection. \n\nQuestion 3: I don't think so, for the same reasons you cited. Only producing just-so-stories is of no value. I mentioned earlier the importance of theories. The other thing where we *could* shine is simply describing behavior. But due to its lack of novelty that has no real value in Psychology.\n\nQuestion 4: No, but do they have to be? Physicists experience gravitation personally, but they can still formalize the concept. The same goes for cognition: We all are cognitive beings, but that doesn't tell us *how* cognition works. Once we figure out mathematical relationships you've abstracted the whole thing away, no matter your personal beliefs about the situation.\n\nQuestion 5: I do believe that a science has to produce insightful conclusions about e.g. behavior to be of value. But we need qualitative methods just as much as quantitative ones. Given my previous arguments for formalization that may come as a surprise, but before you can formalize something you need to understand what it is. Formal methods have awesome properties, but the world's ontology may not be reducible to formalization. If you open a physics textbook, it is not all equations. There is actually a lot of text. Physics has not achieved complete formalization, despite having probably the best shot at it out of all sciences. I believe we will always be only capable of understanding small parts of the world, and that includes cognition. There is no reason to believe cognition is any easier than the physical world, I suspect it's at least on par. Therefore, our explanations of cognition cannot be any simpler than our explanations of the physical world, and they will have to be done on several levels. A chemist does not work on all levels of the physical world, only on a specific one, and doesn't use all the information that is available for these lower levels, only the important ones. What is important? That will have to be left to human intuition. Can we formalize intuition? Maybe, but not in our lifetime. We will always need the gut feeling, the sudden epiphany, to be able to conduct science.\n\nWhat is the outlook for Psychology? I don't know. I'm not seeing the great theoretical advancements. In computer science 10 years are an eternity, in Psychology nothing much has happened. Maybe we can turn around the field to have more replications ([effort is underway](https://osf.io/ezcuj/wiki/home/)), get rid of significance testing and focus on effects, move towards better statistics such as Bayesian statistics and classificators (HMM, SVM etc), and develop theories that do make quantitative predictions ([e.g. Distract-R](http://distract-r.org/index.html)). But it may be too little too late. I agree with u/justsomemammal that behavioral experiments are superior to most applications of brain imaging, but only insofar as they provide input to a functional theory of how things work. Flashy pictures and equations with greek letters *are* convincing for laymen that this is real science.\n\n**tl;dr**: The current state of Psychology is not mainly determined by lazy and stupid Psychologists, rather by the complicated nature of cognition.",

      "text": "Is empiricism ever NOT subject to the theoretical lens? Psychology may have the unfortunate side effect of having LITERALLY EVERYONE think about their own thoughts and the behavior of others, but in terms of its lens, it's either exactly un-focused to produce a clear image, or perfectly focused whereas everyone else is nearly blind. I think it's a mix of both, and I think, again, this effect is present in all fields.\n\nConsider metaphysics vs physics. Ancient metaphysicists may have some up with an intuitive methodology describing the geometry of spacetime (just stay with me for a second on my made-up journey here) but didn't have the tools to make it work. Mathematicians built those. Hooray, XKCD! Philosophy is the true science, and mathematics the true philosophy!\n\nBut seriously. I think asking whether or not psychology is a \"real\" science just boils down to...is it useful? Yes, it produces remarkable predictions for advertising methods. It comes up with therapeutic methods that may rid America of its prison problem. It discovers the nature of how logical or illogical beings sort out the world around them, and provides this knowledge to many other fields which may apply it in interesting ways. It's certainly useful, regardless of how empirical the results it comes up with may be.",

It's relatively easy to observe large patterns and behaviours when trying to determine the weather, which means you can predict 'big' events based on historic data. However, it is incredibly difficult to observe the entire system at the micro level. We can't measure enough data to predict the minor variations accurately enough to make predictions much further in the future. It's difficult to really see how the micro affects the macro since the amount of data that needs to be processed is so indescribably vast. \n\nIn much the same way, psychology has insane numbers of factors to consider. It's impossible to perfectly control any experiment and even when the best controls are given, individuals still have way too many variables to fully control. This is an enormous task, and one which many people feel to be flippant or 'not really science'.\n\nThe difficulty of the work does not make the endeavour any less scientific.

      "text": "A common approach people take to dismiss the \"soft\" sciences, such as psychology, lies in targeting the field's ability to quantify the data it is investigating. I think this reasoning to *dismiss* the field as a \"soft\" science is very, very flawed.\n\n\"Hard\" sciences such as physics, math, and chemistry, are very straightforward in that they are highly quantifiable. There are defined sets of rules, and if those rules are repeatedly broken, the ruleset changes. Things are relatively predictable with hard sciences.\n\nWhen things become harder to quantify, more confounding variables are introduced into your study environment. With psychology, you are literally dealing with something that has a mind of its own - its the very nature of the field of study!\n\nI myself work in ecology (not comfortable calling myself any sort of -ologist yet, but I do have a degree and 3+ years of experience), which is one of the \"softer\" sides of biology. That doesn't make the study of ecology *any less valid*. If anything it requires more creativity and out-of-the-box thinking from the PIs in order to determine which confounding variable is at play. Back to the idea of rulesets, ecology also has rules. These rules are broken *all the time*, and that's just a fact of life. You have to think creatively to figure out *why* the unexpected outcome is happening.\n\nThings become infinitely more complex and difficult to quantify when you are dealing with things with a mind of their own, and this absolutely applies to psychology. Fortunately the social sciences do have statistical tools to aid in quantifying - there's an [entire software suite](http://www-01.ibm.com/software/analytics/spss/) that was originally dedicated to the social sciences, but is now used more broadly as it is an *incredibly* powerful software suite; I myself have used SPSS in analyzing ecological datasets.\n\nWhere am I going with all of this? In conclusion, **the argument that psychology is not a valid science because it is difficult to quantify is a flawed way of thinking**. If anything, because of how infinitely complicated the subject matter is, I have a *huge* amount of respect for psychologists and other social scientists. Sure, psychology has had its bad apples, but keep in mind that it's only recently that we've developed tools to aid in quantifying psychological data - powerful statistical software packages, neural imaging techniques, etc. No scientific field of study is immune from quacks, either. Look at Andrew Wakefield, or, alternatively, the plethora of predatory open-access journals where pseudoscientific \"woo\" gets published on a regular basis. Peer review and critical thinking are integral to science for a reason.\n\nI think psychology is an absolutely valid facet of science as a whole, and in my opinion we need it now more than ever, given the current perceptions and stigma attached to mental illness in today's society.",

      "text": "EDIT: I can't recommend this book enough to people: \"In The Age Of The Smart Machine\" by Shoshana Zuboff. It approaches it from the field of information science and how introducing modern technology into industry affected people's jobs and thus the industries themselves. I'm a biologist, but I found it invaluable in doing intervention research simply because it helped me explain to the investigators that yes, you do have to take into account how the new tools you provide and everything you're presenting is perceived and understood by non-investigators, *especially the subjects.*\n\nHuge. Huge huge huge. Having done both patient-side, clinician-side, and infrastructure-side interventions in doing primary care research, and patient-side interventions in cancer research, psychology is becoming an essential part of how studies are designed, tested, presented, and applied. I don't think I need to get into why it's important for patient-side interventions, so I'll skip to my weird cases.\n\nFor the clinician-side intervention, we queried a large hospital database for vitals, diagnoses, and scripts, and put that info through an algorithm. The algorithm would generate specific care recommendations based upon available evidence, and present it as a pop-up window during an encounter. From designing the window to recruiting and retaining clinicians, we had to account for not just how care flow works, but for how physicians think. People don't like being overridden by a computer, even though we simply presented a recommendation. Doctors don't like being studied; they're not used to being on that side of the microscope. Truly, the most complicated thing about that study was getting into (and out of) a doctor's head, which can be a very strange and hectic place. If that study lacked anything, it was a sociologist or psychologist that could have really teased out some interesting trends in clinician habits and beliefs. Scientists are often very good at the science, but not great at people.\n\nThe infrastructure-side intervention was the opposite: we stuck a server in that gave screening recommendations in very large urban and very small rural practices. It was a relatively invasive process--the practices did not all have electronic medical records or even necessarily electronic scheduling--but we actually had successful \"catches\" from those screening recs during the study period. We had to work with the lowest common denominator to every practice, hence us giving them servers (when I say \"server\" I mean \"1st gen iMac hacked to use its telephone modem for Python script data collection\") and using paper printouts. The reactions were different based upon practice volume and flow, but ultimately just having it there made people pay attention more.\n\nAnalyzing patient care is very complex and involves a LOT of sociological and behavioral science to back it up. Other people I worked with were working directly with psychologists on non-psychological patient interventions. Just fascinating, vital stuff if you want to do good science these days.",

We have a saying in my lab, \"you can always explain anything,\" suggesting that any explanation is useless unless it makes a testable prediction. I would suggest this is why most of psychology has moved towards cognitive science which is essentially neuroscience. If you have a system which can be measured, you can at least make predictions about that system that someone else can demonstrate as false.\n\nIMHO though, even fMRI (favored in cognitive science) is a pretty weak tool and generates tons and tons of \"just-so\" stories because to really test predictions you have to disrupt the system you're measuring (which currently isn't possible in humans).",

Well the girl hit a deer head-on in her car one day and one of the deer's hooves smashed through the window followed by one of her eye sockets and a large part of her frontal lobe. \n\nAfter recovering, and only having vision through one eye, and scarred for life, her attitude and general behavior took a 180 degree turn toward the opposite extreme of social behavior. She became an entirely different person so to speak.\nMedical Science's part of the argument was that the known and explored functions of the part of her brain that was damaged should not have caused such a huge change in her behavior and personality. \nPsychologically one could assume such a prominent girl with a bright future experiencing such a life altering accident could understandably have a sudden shift in personality due to a new outlook on life.\n\nIn reality nobody had a conclusion they could be sure of other than the class members, and Science in general is still curious and baffled about these kinds of things. Her situation was related to other stories of people who experience immense psychological pain and exhibit strange disorders such as never speaking and falling into deep states of unresponsive depression.\n\nI say certainly someone needs to look into and analyze things like this in order to help people in a way where either medical science can step in, or medical science is proven to be unnecessary. but sometimes i think too much analyzing is going on and not enough helping in psychology.",

It is very easy to lie with statistics, especially when your behavioral measures are weak, and your job depends on your publication record.  \n\nHistory informs us that eventually, some of teh research conducted will be remembered as science, and most will be lost,  At that point, psychology will evolve into a true science.  Medicine is an excellent example of a field that is heavily practice oriented, yet uses science to inform the practice.  However Medicine evolved slowly and did not always follow a scientific path.  The germ theory of disease did not inform medical practice until 1870 [disease](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germ_theory_of_disease).

We may want to understand how the world operates because we are interested in gaining that knowledge for the sake of gaining knowledge or we want to solve real world problems (e.g. climate change models that allow us to see how different policies might affect future outcomes; or in psychology: if we give drug A to person from population X their behavior will change from Z to Y). \n\nIn both instances science has two goals 1) to develop a model of the phenomenon (e.g. rescorla-wagner equation) and 2) to determine the factors that contribute to that phenomenon  (e.g. modifications of rescorla-wagner such as Mackintosh's attention variant). Typically, an initial experiment will establish the phenomenon, you then devise a theory, derive predictions, and go test those predictions. If they pan out: kudos to your model! If they do not, you revise the model. Implicit in this process are two things: creative model/theory building and the scientific method. \n\nThe scientific method ostensibly is what separates science from art (although see Thomas Kuhn's thoughts of whether or not science and art are actually different: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions). And to that end, as someone mentioned: people often come to psychologist to develop and refine experimental designs. That is what we are good at! But so are chemist and physicists. It is just with a different substrate. \n\nFor the second point, the model theorizing point, as Box said: all models are wrong. Implicit in such a claim is that we don't discover anything true and that our models are at best a creative story for some phenomenon. This is the misconception I think laypeople  (and perhaps some scientist) have with respect to science: that we are trying to discover something true, that our models are something other than a creative story, and that some sciences do it better than others (e.g. the common notion that physics is a more PURE science than psychology). This is not really the case. All of us are in the business of trying to make sense out of the world. The difference between psychology and chemistry is not in the model-theory building, or in the conducting of experiments, but the substrate of interest. And that point we venture into reductionist arguments (when do we stop reducing?) or saying that one substrate is of more value than another, at which point...I have nothing to say because there is no answer. Thus, from my ramblings, I think a lot of issues that psychology faces today is an issue of miscommunicating what science is in the business of doing and what separates one science from another",

      "text": "Where to begin. I guess I'll just pick a few things. One, psychology is sometimes thought to be common sense (see point 3). But while some psych research is consistent with common sense understanding, other findings are not. The short version of this is that people can hold naive psychological beliefs, BUT people can also hold naive physics beliefs as well. These naive beliefs are based on personal observations and understandings. Science is based on a more rigorous set of observation. This is what separates a scientific psychology, as much as a scientific physics, from common sense.  \n  \nBut can psychology be based on rigorous observation? This boils down to addressing what psychology is studying. If one thinks of the mind as the main topic under consideration, esp if we use the Cartesian view of mind (immaterial, non-spatial, the \"ghost in the machine\") then psychology becomes very problematic as a science. The good thing is that is not how modern psychology (or philosophy of mind, for that matter) views mind. Whether one follows the computational approach to cognition (mind is rule-based processing, implemented in a nervous system) or the embodied approach (mind is an emergent dynamical system arising from nervous activity), there is little acceptance for Cartesian dualism.  \n  \nMore to the point, a problem for psychology is the intent to study things that are unobservable, directy. Psych must deal with constructs like personality, emotion, intelligence, memory, learning, etc. Unless we (like OP) follow in the behaviorist tradition of eliminating constructs from psych and allowing only operational definitions (performance, behavior), then psych seems vaguely unscientific. BUT I would counter that this is not so. Much of the science in psych is about properly trying to define, operationalize, and thus measure these constructs. I hate to put it this way, but its much like detecting the Higgs Boson. One cannot see the boson, but it is a construct that fits within a theoretical framework, and predictions can be made about its effects in certain experiments. But to be clear, the data analyzed in the discovery of the HB is just a statistical operationalization of the HB, and in many ways this is the same methodology used in science to measure the aforementioned constructs.  \n  \nOne may object that there is  key difference in the constructs, but that isn't entirely true. Part of the problem is that psychologists use terms that overlap naive psychology (personality, intelligence, etc) but its important to realize that the psychologist's use of the term is not the same as the naive use of the term. Higgs Bosons don't exist in naive physics so they don't get questioned as being \"fuzzy science\" like psychology, but they are ever so fuzzy.  \n  \nWe have boil this down to understanding scientific epistemology. Too much emphasis is placed on objective observation (positivism). Most sciences do not anymore rely on direct objective observations. Nearly all sciences now deal with inobservables that must be rigorously defined within a logically coherent theoretical framework that must make predictions (hypothetico-deductive) and be verifiable and/or falsifiable (this is logical positivism, not old fashioned positivism).  \n  \nIn this sense, psychology might be seen as the more difficult of the sciences, because of the challenges faced in creating a logically coherent theoretical framework. While physics has not been unified, it at least has boiled down to 2 main branches seeking unification. Psychology is further away, being divided into so many diverse sub-fields. It greatly lacks theoretical unification. In large part this may stem from the fact that I don't think we really know what the brain does. All we have are metaphors. The digital computer metaphor has been popular for awhile but is falling out of fashion, so we need a new metaphor, but importantly we need a metaphor that will provide a universal framework for all of psychology. In short, the field is effectively in its infancy. Like Einstein revolutionized physics in the 20th century, psychology is awaiting a similar paradigm shift. In this sense it is an exciting time to be an experimental psychologist, I do sense the time is ripe.  \n  \nLast, just to throw a wrench in it all, addressing OP point 4, what value of psych to other sciences? I know how some want to take a reductionist view. Here's my straw man view of it: sociology reduces to anthropology, which reduces to psychology, which reduces to biology, which reduces to chemistry which reduces to physics. If we take such a view seriously, all the sciences are important because they are links in a chain, providing different levels of analysis. There's another view where everything reduces to psychology. The argument being that all knowledge reduces to observation, sensation & perception, so in order to understand physics, for example, one would have to understand the process of observation itself which is perception, and the domain of psychology. Psychophysics would be the domain at the base of it all. (this is actually Ernst Mach's phenomenological view of science)",

      "text": "I'm busy reading Rom Harre's *Cognitive Science - A Philosophical Introduction* and as he takes exception to the view of psychology as the science of behavior as a misguided attempt to ape the physical sciences. Noam Chomsky has similar reservations about the behaviorists general application of the positivist philosophy of science. Positivism has been rejected by most philosophers of science as inadequate, and has never appealed to a majority of physical scientists. \n\nRom Harre defines a science as an ordered catalog of phenomena that is explained by reference to a system of models representing the mechanisms by which these phenomena are caused. He claims that a scientist needs a system of concepts for classifying phenomena and an accepted source of concepts as a means of controlling the making of models that represent the causal mechanisms.\n\nThe difficulty that psychology has had in establishing itself as a hard science has been finding ways to guide model making. By and large the apparatus available for the best part of \"scientific\" psychology's history (i.e. statistics) have been wholly inadequate for all but the simplest and most boring psychological questions (e.g. average reaction time of people). Other methods such as utility/game theoretic models and GOFAI models were very exciting when they were first conceived, but soon proved to be all but useless as scientific models of psychological mechanisms.\n\nPsychology as a science is a German invention and was born in an era and climate of intense turning inward of people to learn to know their true selves known as German romanticism. While most German intellectuals of the time thought natural philosophy inadequate to reveal and explain the inner world. In recent times the topic has gained popularity as the problem of consciousness. On the whole it seems very difficult to argue that a true \"science\" of consciousness or of self has been established. Tantalizing speculations have been made by some very brilliant theorists and philosophers, and we have some ability to make vague statistical predictions regarding personality types, but no scientific explanation of consciousness or self-hood as of yet I don't think.\n\nIf you want to make the claim that the experimental search for statistical regularities in behavior constitutes a science, I might be inclined to agree, but I would call that science ethology and not psychology.\n\nPsychology as the study of the nature of the mind, consciousness and self has not yet achieved a scientific understanding of it's subject matter. But the job of a scientist is to further our collective scientific understanding, so a real scientist might happen to study psychology in the course of doing science, while psychology as a branch of knowledge has not yet achieved scientific status.\n\nAt this stage I would say the most exciting prospects for psychology lies in the development of computational neuro-psychological models of agents embedded in a socio-economic systems that are themselves modeled using sophisticated computational models. But the achievement of this seems a long way off.",

Psychology can and does study how situations, beliefs, attitudes, personality traits, etc. cause different behaviors, emotions, and thoughts. That's the science. Saying that psychologists can't yet \"explain self-hood\" is vague enough to be basically meaningless.\n\nAnother way of looking at it - physicists can make predictions, but I have yet to come across a coherent, fully satisfying explanation of what matter, energy, or space-time \"are\" that doesn't eventually just become a mathematical formula. The same is of course true of psychology - it can make predictions, but want to understand a philosophical concept like \"consciousness\" or \"self-hood\"? Psychology can inform those questions, but in the end you're barking up the wrong tree.",

      "text": "Psychology lacks the rigor and discipline of the so-called \"natural sciences.\" Often times experiments are still highly up to interpretation after the results are in. You don't have as much of a problem with that in other sciences. If my knockout strain produces a different phenotype and the gene has been confirmed by PCR, then clearly that gene plays a role in the phenotype. There is not much that can be argued. In psych though, you have a data set that suggests something, but their is no hard physical principle you can work it back to. \n\n It is also extremely easy to cook your experiment for the results you want. I have taken a few questionnaires for a little extra cash by well-respected psychology researchers and the questions often times don't give you enough freedom to answer how you really wish to respond. All science's ask questions while anticipating the answer, but I think psychology is particularly bad. \n\nPsychology is also dampened by politics and social norms in ways other sciences aren't. The NMR machine doesn't give a fuck what your opinion on gender relations on college campus is, but the person performing an interview may. Now your study might have nothing to do with this, but biases come up all over the place and it has the potential to skew your results. \n\nI am not saying psychology isn't useful, but it is in the murky world of social science. I look at it this way, humanities are what you think, social sciences are what you can provide evidence for, hard sciences are what you can show beyond a reasonable doubt, and mathematics is what you can work up from first principles alone. Psychology will always be in that social sciences category because no matter how much evidence you get, you will never get 100% reproducible results.",

      "text": "I've spent the entirety of my academic career questioning this debate. I've learned that everyone has an opinion on the subject, which I personally find quite fascinating. But I don't think it is the methodology that truly draws the slings and arrows to the subject. I think it is because Psychology is inherently threatening in quite a number of ways. It can undermine anything within the human experience, often making remarks about human behavior that can be unsettling to just about anyone, in any field, scientific and otherwise. Philosophy suffers from this same issue and has in the past drawn outrageous amounts of criticism from all sides.\n\nPsychology is a vast area of study, not because its handling the sheer number of variables that Physics claims, or the infinite combinations of the same ideas within mathematics, but because it is the study of the researcher themselves. The mirror examining the mirror, casting an infinite number of reflections. The researcher that with every generation gets more educated, more inundated with data, and is exposed to an ever-growing environment of social interaction. It is the only science that spends its entire time studying the primary tool used in the development and ongoing study of science: the mind, and by extension the brain. The brain is concrete enough that anatomists, surgeons, and other specialists have studied it for the longest time. But it's a black box, and specifically a black box they are using to study black boxes.\n\nScience is the extension of older philosophical logic into a progressive discipline that seeks to answer questions by eliminating variables until a point of 'trust' is reached... The great search for facts on the road to finding truth. Science in general is all about finding firm ground to stand on from which to make further estimations and assertions to study. Due to this, criticisms, concerns, and simple observations of the engine of science (the mind) have the power to shake all of the other areas that require dedication to pursue. I don't mean this as a \"Woo! Psychology is the best, most fundamental science!\" but rather \"Psychology presents a serious existential danger to all other sciences.\"\n\nWho wants to hear that all of their past works may have suffered from a confirmation bias? Or that a small heuristic inherent to human cognitive development has made it impossible for them to perceive the totality of a single moment of their world? It brings in massive questions that threaten to undermine what has already been achieved. How much has fallen within the blind spot, covered up by the brain to prevent undue stress to the observer? How much is the mind making up every day? How can we trust our memories of yesterday's experiment?\n\nSo in my mind, every time I hear someone say \"Well, Psychology isn't a hard science.\" I ask myself not just why they think that, but how they would do the same research from the perspective of their area of study. Often when I ask these questions directly, pointing out the many things you have to account for when pursuing any major Psychological work, they end up confounded by the nebulous nature of the primary subject involved. The human being.\n\nPsychology is a discipline that has to constantly strive to pull form and function from the smoke of the ever changing mind; made slightly less difficult when you are studying the physical mechanics, and infinitely moreso once the word 'consciousness' comes up in the room. It is subject to a zeitgeist moving so quickly and effecting/affecting us so fundamentally, that we always seem to have more questions than answers. Whenever something is found to be mostly a fact, it tends to spin off a new discipline entirely. Look at the cognitive work that has spun off into the computer sciences in the 1970s, for example, or more recently Neuroscience. Or in the ongoing search for artificial cognition. Whenever we learn something about ourselves in the process, we don't just have to go back and re-check our work, we have to re-check our instrumentation. We have to re-check ourselves. Then everyone finished the self-pat-down nods to each other in concragulations, then throw a new name on the discipline and go chasing after it.\n\nThe fundamental question of psychology becomes: How does a tool calibrate itself, to measure its own efficacy? How can it ever achieve any sense of certainty regarding itself? How can it ever defend itself against claims of being fallible? How does it defend itself from the sciences that see it as a threat to their own methodology? As usual, you end up with more questions than answers.",

It's like an onion: there're layers upon layers of \"challenges\", most of them faced only by a few who in turn choose to neglect other challenges. \n\nThe DSM, for example, is so obviously flawed in its design that it's shameful. Most, if not all, psychiatric diagnoses are symptom based and spread normally in the general population. The honest way to approach this is to define, say, the top 5% sufferers as sick and construct the diagnostic evaluation around this. Instead we have this arbitrary, clouded method that you have to have at least n symptoms out of a list of y symptoms. \n\nThis is just an example of one of the many problems in the field that are out in the open, for everyone to see, yet that remain unadressed even though they are far from impossible to address. Another one is the issue of frequentist statistics: Why stick to them when Bayesian appears to be better in every way?\n\nMy time is limited at the moment so I'll refer to Ben Goldacre, Richard Bentall, Allan V.

I think that there is a disconnect between a neuroscientist's definition of an appropriate model and that of a psychologist because of the degree of specificity required in the former's experiments.  It's a matter of perspective.  In the neuro community we have to take a ground up approach, i.e. data must be isolated from all confounds to the highest degree.  In psychological studies there is less of a need to isolate from confounds because the broad conclusions being sought preclude such an approach.  \n\nAs to whether psychology is a science?

The basic idea is that we can analyse behavior on 3 levels: What is the meaning? What is the algorithm? And how is it implemented? \n\nI'll try to map that on what I understand an accountant is doing. You're looking at numbers. These numbers have a specific meaning. They tell you how the company is run, what's going on internally. A take home message could be 'Is a specific project on track'? That is the computational level. It gives you a 'gut feeling' about these things. If a colleague asks you about the status of that project, your first answer will probably not be '.25', but 'It's a bit over budget'. Making sure that the numbers are allright is not the end goal, but only a necessary one if the final statement about the state of affairs should be correct. The algorithmic level is 'How do we add up the numbers properly'. In the end, we want to have an instrument to steer projects, groups, companies in the right direction, but how we treat the numbers does matter. The implementational level would be 'I use Excel' vs 'I just add the numbers by hand'. Any algorithm has to be expressed physically eventually. You can't stay on an abstract level forever, at some point something has to happen in the physical world. This can be data on a computer or a written sheet of paper.\n\nNow, Psychology is concerned with the algorithmic level. What functions can we observe in behavior? How are items stored in memory? How are they retrieved? How do we judge the distance to an object far away? How do we judge the difference between the weight of two objects? Neuroscience is concerned with the implementation. How is this abstract function carried out in the brain? Remember,  algorithms have to go physical at some point, otherwise nothing happens. \n\nThe common problem of Neuroscience and Psychology is that we don't have much algorithms of behavior. The neuro people can see if something changes on the implementatinal level, that is in the brain. But they don't really know **why** it changes. We Psychologists can only see if the resulting behavior changes, but don't know what's happening on the brain level. Until we don't have functional theories of behavior, Psychology and Neuroscience won't be able to tell each other much.",

      "text": "Feynman had something to say about this:\n\n>Other kinds of errors are more characteristic of poor science. When I was at Cornell, I often talked to the people in the psychology department. One of the students told me she wanted to do an experiment that went something like this--it had been found by others that under certain circumstances, X, rats did something, A. She was curious as to whether, if she changed the circumstances to Y, they would still do A. So her proposal was to do the experiment under circumstances Y and see if they still did A.\n\n>I explained to her that it was necessary first to repeat in her laboratory the experiment of the other person--to do it under condition X to see if she could also get result A, and then change to Y and see if A changed. Then she would know the the real difference was the thing she thought she had under control.\n\n>She was very delighted with this new idea, and went to her professor. And his reply was, no, you cannot do that, because the experiment has already been done and you would be wasting time. This was in about 1947 or so, and it seems to have been the general policy then to not try to repeat psychological experiments, but only to change the conditions and see what happened.\n\n>Nowadays, there's a certain danger of the same thing happening, even in the famous field of physics. I was shocked to hear of an experiment being done at the big accelerator at the National Accelerator Laboratory, where a person used deuterium. In order to compare his heavy hydrogen results to what might happen with light hydrogen, he had to use data from someone else's experiment on light hydrogen, which was done on different apparatus. When asked why, he said it was because he couldn't get time on the program (because there's so little time and it's such expensive apparatus) to do the experiment with light hydrogen on this apparatus because there wouldn't be any new result. And so the men in charge of programs at NAL are so anxious for new results, in order to get more money to keep the thing going for public relations purposes, they are destroying--possibly--the value of the experiments themselves, which is the whole purpose of the thing. It is often hard for the experimenters there to complete their work as their scientific integrity demands.\n\n>All experiments in psychology are not of this type, however. For example, there have been many experiments running rats through all kinds of mazes, and so on--with little clear result. But in 1937 a man named Young did a very interesting one. He had a long corridor with doors all along one side where the rats came in, and doors along the other side where the food was. He wanted to see if he could train the rats to go in at the third door down from wherever he started them off. No. The rats went immediately to the door where the food had been the time before.\n\n>The question was, how did the rats know, because the corridor was so beautifully built and so uniform, that this was the same door as before? Obviously there was something about the door that was different from the other doors. So he painted the doors very carefully, arranging the textures on the faces of the doors exactly the same. Still the rats could tell. Then he thought maybe the rats were smelling the food, so he used chemicals to change the smell after each run. Still the rats could tell. Then he realized the rats might be able to tell by seeing the lights and the arrangement in the laboratory like any commonsense person. So he covered the corridor, and still the rats could tell.\n\n>He finally found that they could tell by the way the floor sounded when they ran over it. And he could only fix that by putting his corridor in sand. So he covered one after another of all possible clues and finally was able to fool the rats so that they had to learn to go in the third door. If he relaxed any of his conditions, the rats could tell.\n\n>Now, from a scientific standpoint, that is an A-number-one experiment. That is the experiment that makes rat-running experiments sensible, because it uncovers that clues that the rat is really using-- not what you think it's using. And that is the experiment that tells exactly what conditions you have to use in order to be careful and control everything in an experiment with rat-running.\n\n>I looked up the subsequent history of this research. The next experiment, and the one after that, never referred to Mr. Young. They never used any of his criteria of putting the corridor on sand, or being very careful. They just went right on running the rats in the same old way, and paid no attention to the great discoveries of Mr. Young, and his papers are not referred to, because he didn't discover anything about the rats. In fact, he discovered all the things you have to do to discover something about rats. But not paying attention to experiments like that is a characteristic example of cargo cult science.\n\nNow, it's been 40 years since this was written, and obviously, psychology's advanced quite a bit since then, but it still suffers from a lot of the same problems.",

Indian Psychology was into the study of Hindu and Buddhist meditation techniques long before it became a fashion statement. Unfortunately, people in this field have FAILED TO BE SCIENTIFIC and instead of following the data,  they've attempted to push religious agendas of how all suffering and conflict is solved by transcending into the infinite Brahman.

Psychology can and does study how situations, beliefs, attitudes, personality traits, etc. cause different behaviors, emotions, and thoughts. That's the science. Saying that psychologists can't yet \"explain self-hood\" is vague enough to be basically meaningless.\n\nAnother way of looking at it - physicists can make predictions, but I have yet to come across a coherent, fully satisfying explanation of what matter, energy, or space-time \"are\" that doesn't eventually just become a mathematical formula. The same is of course true of psychology - it can make predictions, but want to understand a philosophical concept like \"consciousness\" or \"self-hood\"? Psychology can inform those questions, but in the end you're barking up the wrong tree.",

      "text": "Maybe David Marr's [Levels of analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Marr_%28neuroscientist%29#Levels_of_analysis) help here. The basic idea is that we can analyse behavior on 3 levels: What is the meaning? What is the algorithm? And how is it implemented? \n\nI'll try to map that on what I understand an accountant is doing. You're looking at numbers. These numbers have a specific meaning. They tell you how the company is run, what's going on internally. A take home message could be 'Is a specific project on track'? That is the computational level. It gives you a 'gut feeling' about these things. If a colleague asks you about the status of that project, your first answer will probably not be '.25', but 'It's a bit over budget'. Making sure that the numbers are allright is not the end goal, but only a necessary one if the final statement about the state of affairs should be correct. The algorithmic level is 'How do we add up the numbers properly'. In the end, we want to have an instrument to steer projects, groups, companies in the right direction, but how we treat the numbers does matter. The implementational level would be 'I use Excel' vs 'I just add the numbers by hand'. Any algorithm has to be expressed physically eventually. You can't stay on an abstract level forever, at some point something has to happen in the physical world. This can be data on a computer or a written sheet of paper.\n\nNow, Psychology is concerned with the algorithmic level. What functions can we observe in behavior? How are items stored in memory? How are they retrieved? How do we judge the distance to an object far away? How do we judge the difference between the weight of two objects? Neuroscience is concerned with the implementation. How is this abstract function carried out in the brain? Remember,  algorithms have to go physical at some point, otherwise nothing happens. \n\nThe common problem of Neuroscience and Psychology is that we don't have much algorithms of behavior. The neuro people can see if something changes on the implementatinal level, that is in the brain. But they don't really know **why** it changes. We Psychologists can only see if the resulting behavior changes, but don't know what's happening on the brain level. Until we don't have functional theories of behavior, Psychology and Neuroscience won't be able to tell each other much.",

I was simply pointing out that the reasons people state for psychology not being real are found in all of the major disciplines. \nI'm of the mindset that questions should drive methods and not visa versa. So, depending on what question I'm asking, I dig into my psychology tool box to find the best method. Sometimes that method is neuro, but other times it's eye tracking, or observational work, or reaction times, or even cross-species research... And all of those methods are equally scientifically \"real\"",

Soon after though, grad students in that program could choose to get a Psychology degree or a Biology degree. I've worked in Bio departments and Psych departments, so I can switch. ;-)\n\nMy best advice for anyone who wants to work with animals is to volunteer - spend hours with animals and their caretakers, volunteer for conservation jobs, find out exactly what you want to do in your career, then the path becomes a lot easier to find. Your undergraduate degree is not as important, but studying biology, zoology, and/or psychology is certainly helpful!",

We're hoping for even more that is unexpected, but knowing that there are probably...\n\n* coalescing neutron stars and black holes, inspiraling together\n* supernovae\n* neutron stars with bumps and internal vibrations and accreted companions\n* the stochastic background of the universe\n\n... helps us to design analyses. If we have an idea what the waveform is, we can look for it even if it is much smaller than the average noise -- because what matters is how many \"false alarms\" match, not just noise at a given frequency, but noise of that particular waveform. Even though Advanced LIGO's best sensitivity will be about 4e-24, that is, four parts in a trillion-trillionth, rather noteworthy already, we might do a hundred times better than that looking for very specific signals from some pulsars. The more data we have, the deeper we can go. \n\nFor merging stars as well as neutron stars emitting their own gravitational waves, we can model thees waveforms. For supernovae and the stochastic background, we often combine the output of detectors and compare against each other -- which indeed is useful for confirming, or making more sensitive, the other analyses too.\n\nLastly, electrical equipment itself can be tricky! There are a lot of subtleties about how much power to put on the photodiode during the measurement, how much analog whitening and anti-aliasing goes into the analog-to-digital converters, and other arts! But it's all calibrated -- multiple ways, including by tracing the chain of motion that goes into our mirrors as well as by pushing on the mirrors with a laser to measure the minuscle displacement caused by light pressure. The calibrations agree; we're quite sure the instrument is doing what it's supposed to be doing.\n-GM",

For some types of analyses, data processing can last months too!

Every with hundreds of thousands of users contributing CPU cycles, every bit of help is appreciated! The reason these analyses take so long is twofold: 1) continuous neutron star signals are very probably well below the noise floor, so we need to integrate a lot of data to find them 2) integrate a lot of data makes it very sensitive to wrong signal models, so we need to test our models very carefully!\n\nTraditionally searches for burst, inspirals, and the stochastic background have been quicker! We hope that an inspiral could be identified within a few minutes of an event, possibly even sooner, and we have a fast lookup mechanism to contact electromagnetic astronomers so they can turn their telescopes and look for the same event.\n-GM",

      "text": "Neither, actually. I would first question our predictions of how common the astrophysical events we are looking for are. There is a lot of uncertainty about how common binary black hole mergers and binary neutron star mergers are, and these are expected to be the first and most common source of signals that we see. When Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo are running at their full design sensitivities in 2019/2020, for example, we anticipate between 0.2 and 200 binary neutron star signals per year. Obviously the difference between one every 5 years and one every few days is pretty huge. So if we don‚Äôt see any signals at all, I would think it most likely that we‚Äôve generally overestimated how common these events are, since we clearly have a lot of uncertainty there.\n\nBy comparison there is strong inferential observational evidence that gravitational waves do exist, and a robust theory predicting them (see Hulse-Taylor binary discussion).\n\nWe also study the behaviour of our detectors intensely and, when we are taking data, we perform what we call ‚Äúblind injections‚Äù. This is when a few people in our collaboration secretly add a fake signal into the data coming out of the detector, to test whether we can find the signal and that we understand the instrument properly. During a science run of the initial LIGO experiment, a signal was seen that looked like a binary merger at a distance of about 60 - 180 million light years, coming from the direction of the constellation Canis Major (the signal was later called the ‚ÄúBig Dog‚Äù). The collaboration proceeded to do the full suite of analysis and check everything over and over, then wrote a paper claiming the first detection. Only then was it revealed at a collaboration meeting that the signal was a blind injection! While that might be a little disappointing, it shows that we are prepared and understand the instruments enough to be confident that they work as expected.(AW)",

I don't believe medical examiners should be prosecutors and certainly not vice versa. It's up to the prosecution to correctly apply the work done by the medical examiner in accordance with existing laws. It's a stretch comparison but it's the best I could come up with on short notice :) I hope that's ok.\n\nI've read numerous articles on both sides of this debate (if you can even call it that) that were written by the scientists themselves who built the models and performed the studies leading to their conclusions and almost every time the encroachment of opinion distorts the science. \n\n> ‚ÄúThe impression that climate change can be so predicted and managed is not only misleading, but it could also have negative repercussions should policy makers act on this assumption.‚Äù By this they meant that ‚Äúthe societal perception that the ‚Äòclimate change problem‚Äô is being adequately handled could inhibit the emergence of, and support for, creative social, policy and economic responses to the challenge of coping with a possibly inherently unpredictable system such as climate.‚Äù\n\nIn other words, when scientists say \"the sky is falling\" instead of simply presenting facts/data bad things happen.

      "text": ">Hi Reddit,\n\n>We're Margaret Kosmala and Koen Hufkens at Harvard University and Josh Gray at Boston University. We're part of a research group that has been putting automated cameras on weather towers and other elevated platforms to study the the seasonal timing of changes in plants, shrubs, and trees ‚Äì called 'phenology'. Because this timing of when plants leaf, flower, and fruit is very sensitive to changes in weather, plant phenology alerts us to changing climate patterns. Our network of about 300 cameras ('PhenoCams') take pictures of vegetated landscapes every half hour, every day, all year round. (That's a lot of pictures!) With the data from these images we can figure the relationships between plant phenology and local weather and then predict the effects of future climate using models. \n\n>We also use images from satellites to broaden the extent of our analyses beyond the 300 specific sites where we have cameras. And we use citizen science to help turn our PhenoCam images into usable data, through our [Season Spotter project](http://seasonspotter.org/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=reddit). Anyone can go to Season Spotter and answer a few short questions about an image to help us better interpret the image. Right now we are running a ‚Äúspring challenge‚Äù to classify 9,500 images of springtime. With the results, we will be able to pinpoint the first and last days of spring, which will help calibrate climate change models.\n\n>UPDATE: We're done with our Season Spotter spring images, thanks! Since it's fall in half the world, we've loaded up our [fall images](http://seasonspotter.org/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=reddit). We have another 9,700 of those to classify, as well. \n\n>We'll be back at 1 pm EDT (10 am PDT, 6 pm UTC) to answer your questions; we're looking forward to talking to you about climate change, plants, and public participation in science!\n\n>UPDATE 1 pm Eastern: We're now answering questions!\n\n>**UPDATE 3 pm Eastern: Josh has to leave for a meeting. But Koen and Margaret will stick around and answer some more questions. Ask away if you have more of them.**",

Some of the Phenocams have an infrared band (they are security cameras and this is the low-light feature) that we've tried to use to get something like NDVI, [see this paper](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fharvardforest.fas.harvard.edu%2Fsites%2Fharvardforest.fas.harvard.edu%2Ffiles%2Fpublications%2Fpdfs%2FPetach_AgriForestMeteor_2014.pdf&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGfev9HpAeN8wKPXfLyZrSWj3hkyw).\n\nWe've explored various machine learning approaches for a variety of purposes including snow detection, species classification, etc. We have not explored machine learning as a method of estimating phenological transition dates, though. We rely on curve-fitting for that.\n\nI'm personally just coming to understand the content of citizen science data. Phenology is special in this regard because there are troves of phenological data collected by citizens observing their gardens and neighborhoods. And it's generally pretty easy for anyone to collect the data, no tools, minimal training, etc: has this tree bloomed yet? So, I think the short answer is that citizen scientists are an excellent source of quantitative as well as qualitative data on phenology.",

Some of the Phenocams have an infrared band (they are security cameras and this is the low-light feature) that we've tried to use to get something like NDVI, [see this paper](http://goo.gl/p6g55m).\nWe've explored various machine learning approaches for a variety of purposes including snow detection, species classification, etc. We have not explored machine learning as a method of estimating phenological transition dates, though. We rely on curve-fitting for that.\nI'm personally just coming to understand the content of citizen science data. Phenology is special in this regard because there are troves of phenological data collected by citizens observing their gardens and neighborhoods. And it's generally pretty easy for anyone to collect the data, no tools, minimal training, etc: has this tree bloomed yet? So, I think the short answer is that citizen scientists are an excellent source of quantitative as well as qualitative data on phenology.",

There are many ways we can set up a project so that the help that volunteers give us can be used in a hard science, number-wise way. For example, in [Season Spotter](http://bit.ly/1RzRa4l), we show each image or pairs of images to at least 5 people. If they all agree (on say, if flowers are present), then we have high confidence that flowers are present. If they don't agree, we know that it's hard to tell. I've helped show that this approach works really well and produces high-quality quantitative data in other citizen science projects.",

When there was money to be had in tobacco and second hand smoke, a lot of funding went into and research came out, surprise, surprise, stating that second hand smoke wasn't a big problem.  Concussion research is another example of money being thrown at the issue with a predestined outcome.  And on and on.  It frankly isn't as simple as to just deny that this is a possibility.  And it did not help when emails were leaked that suggested that certain data not be published because it went against the narrative.  This needs to be addressed.  Not all of the people who aren't on board are knuckle dragging climate deniers.  There are a lot of highly intelligent people who are justifiably cynical because of how science has been bought and sold in the past to the highest bidder, and if you can't get funding because your results are against the manifest weight of the popular agenda, it's pretty hard to keep your lab open.  And when good science is tainted by bias, political agendas, and evidence of lowering scientific ethics, it hurts the true goal - research regardless of outcome.",

I used the depth, gravity and magnetic data to study the structure of seamounts (extinct volcanoes) on the ocean floor, and to observe the bending of the tectonic plates as they sagged under the weight of the mountains.

I am vaguely aware that the oceans are different heights (otherwise the Panama Canal would be a lot simpler). Besides the impact of the moon's gravitational pull, how is that possible?  \n2. Besides the obvious flooding and salination of groundwater in coastal water tables, what are the effects that rising sea levels will have?  \n3. I noticed several of you are from JPL, which I know best in the context of the novel *The Martian*. Is that book accurate to the workings of NASA (you're not manned missions to Mars, I know, but the culture and day-to-day operations), and does it accurately portray what you do in JPL?  \n4. When do you expect to transition Jason-2 to ocean floor mapping, and where is it going to be focused?  \n5. What are you most excited for with this project? Is there a particular part of ocean floor you want to map, or a particular ocean-height phenomenon you want more data on, or something like that?",

If the shapes are right, the sizes and distances must be wrong; if the sizes are right, the shapes must be wrong; and so on. This is why NOAA developed Science on a Sphere, a spherical projection screen for looking at planetary data:\nhttp://sos.noaa.gov/What_is_SOS/index.html\n\nTo answer the question: the topography of the sea floor is often shown in a conformal (correct angle) projection, because the angles between plate boundaries are important in the theory of plate tectonics.\n--WHFSmith",

It was originally developed in the U.S. at JHU APL under NASA Instrument Incubator funding and proven in aircraft flights. The European Space Agency‚Äôs CryoSat mission adopted it. Unfortunately the first CryoSat perished in a launch failure and so it was not until 2010 that we were able to get data from space with this technique. It has proven so successful that it is being cloned for Sentinel-3 and cloned and improved for Jason-CS/Sentinel-6. These are all using radar at Ku band.\n\nMeanwhile the French space agency CNES has also developed a nadir-looking altimeter at Ka-band and the Indian space agency ISRO gave it a ride recently. Both Delay/Doppler at Ku and also Ka are showing big improvements (almost a factor of two in precision) compared to traditional Ku altimetry.\n\nThe question about Jason-2 and ocean floor mapping is answered in some of my other replies.\n--WHFSmith",

First it will help to define the amount of heat available in the ocean to potentially be tapped into by a tropical cyclone. The ocean heat data or content is used as input to hurricane forecast models to best address intensity. Second is longer term, significant wave heights from satellite altimeters are used as sea truth for operational wave prediction models and improve the performance of those models. NOAA will be upgrading its tropical cyclone prediction system, the Hurricane WRF system this coming year, to be coupled with the ocean and wave models, to better account for the ocean and wave interactions.  SO JASON-3 will help improve both tropical cyclone forecasts of intensity and wave heights. \nFor longer term prediction a whole array of observations from satellites, balloons, aircraft, land stations, buoys, ocean sensors (including the altimeters) help define the state of the earth system (ocean, atmosphere, ocean waves). That initial state is then used as the starting point for numerical prediction models such as the NOAA Global Forecast System (GFS), HWRF, and others.

I was not surprised starting with NOAA/NWS after grad school and have been very lucky and has continued to be challenging. In my 27 years we have been fortunate to see computational capabilities, earth observations, communications, and our predictive capability improve to a point  of routinely being able to provide quality predictions. But it is still weather and challenging. The skills needed are changing and require people that can communicate, are technically savy with computers, and have a solid formal background in weather. We are also looking to social science to better understand how to communicate. \nJS",

I don't have time to tell it all again.\nBasically, I had no idea this stuff existed until I got to college. I didn't see any Earth or Ocean Science in my junior high or high school.\nI just kept asking about things I was curious about, and when something was fun, I followed up on it. And that fun carried me through, and i am still having fun.\nI would say, carve out a little time on a regular basis (an hour a week, more if you can) and search for info. Check the Education offices at NOAA and NASA and ask them what they have for students and teachers at your level, and above your level, and keep trying to learn new stuff. And when you find you passion, go for it.\n\nI got where I am through geology and then geophysics and then marine geophysics, always with an interest in math and physics. But I didn't plan my career. I just keep having fun, and here I am.\n\nGood luck!\n\n--WHFSmith",

I am an engineer, not a climatologist; neither am I as well read on this subject as I could be. However, when I am presented with this sort of analysis, I always want to see the underlying data. The analysis of the data sets used to create these graphs is very complex and there are a lot of factors to consider. For example, how do they compensate for the urban heat island or other statistically significant factors? My point is that although these links illustrate a lot of consensus from some very respectable organizations on this issue, they leave some important issues raised by the OP unanswered. How successful are these climate models at predicting/explaining our current climate conditions? We always have to be wary of extrapolating based on an incomplete data set. Also, our understanding of our environment is far from complete and we certainly don't understand all of the feedback mechanisms that may or may not be present. What I mean by all of this is that though these sites are informative and useful, they don't conclusively prove to me that global warming is caused by humans. I should note that I am in favor of cutting emissions and environmental responsibility. I just want to see some of the hard science behind this before I can firmly support the statement that humans are causing global warming. Then again, I am sure that many of the research papers on which these findings are based are publicly available, so I guess I have no right to whine until I do more research.",

The rest are policy, opinion and consensus all of which carries no weight with me.\n\n2 however looks like a pretty solid introduction to the topic and worth reading by anyone who thinks the hypothesis is true or false. (Most people who think it is true think so for no reason just like most of the people who think it is false. If you haven't looked at the data you think something for no reason.)\n\nI think I have read 18 or the UN version of it I think before. My major problem with all science journalism is lack of error bars, the Earth will warm by 3 C, well I draw your attention to page 7. SPM.5. Please look at the error bars. It should be clear that there is a lot of work to be done still...\n\nEDIT: On data. Like I said if you don't look at the data you don't have a reason for believing something. Let me also add some tips for the non-scientists trying to look at data. When looking at data, think is there some way this data could be plotted that would look less convincing, or even say the opposite thing. You'll be surprised how often the answer is yes. Never trust data without error bars unless you understand the experiment well enough to know the errors are just too small to show.\n\nAs an example. Take the first plot in (2) http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/globalwarming/ar4-fig-3-6.gif\nIt is fluctuations about a mean value, what is that mean value? It is the integrated mean of 1961-1990. Is there any window that would make it look more like noise? (Hint -0.2 C as 0 might lead to a slightly less strong argument for those not looking carefully at all of the data).",

          "text": "There can be **absolutely no doubt that the earth is getting dramatically warmer.** The best measure of the Earth's increase in temperature is to [measure the current sea level rise.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_sea_level_rise)  The sea level has been rising in a virtually straight line for the last century (when CO2 levels have been increasing in an almost straight line but with slight upward parabolic corrections to slope).  The sea level has risen at a 1-2 mm a year this century, and this was observed before anyone knew that humans were increasing CO2 levels.  Recent, much more accurate, satellite altimetry shows that the sea level has been rising in a straight line for the last decade plus, but at a higher rate of 3 cm /decade.  This rate is expected to increase dramatically as warmer temperatures from CO2 put more water vapor and methane greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere. For example, the presence of a large, warm El Nino this year lead to reliable predictions in the fall that CA and the East Coast would have an extremely wet late winter and summer (more evaporation off of a hot El Nino means more precipitation at colder latitudes), and that the NW U.S. would be warm and dry.   \n\nBoth global warming deniers and some alarmists love to cherry pick extremely sparse surface temperature data, and sea surface temperature data, to justify their theories.  Since some parts of the world are getting colder, and some parts of the world are expected to get much colder due to global warming (especially the NE U.S. and Europe), we can't rely on these point measurements. \n\nTo explain the rise of the sea level data (while denying the nearly 1:1 .99 correlation with increases in CO2) deniers have to both invent new physics to deny the physics behind the greenhouse effect, and then blame the warming on something else (usually the sun).  Yes, the brightness of the sun does fluctuate very slightly with the sunspot cycle.   This small fluctuation of intensity is largely absent in the sea level rise data, other than squiggles on a rising straight line.  [Here is a bullshit graph that uses non-sea-level temperature data on a global warming denier website](http://icecap.us/images/uploads/PDOAMOTEMP.jpg) In the first place, notice their huge fluctuations in temperature data that are almost absent the very substantial and linear rise in sea level data.  There should be large fluctuations in surface temperature data because it's a profoundly inaccurate measure of temperature.  This graph's temperature data is wrong, because it disagrees with sea level data.  And there's no evidence (off of climate denier websites) of some profound and regular (hugely long period oscillation of the sun's temperature... we have sunspot data going back to Newton's time).  So these kinds of graphs have manage to line up two dubious datasets and make them match.  Bullshit in-> dubious fit comes out.  \n\nWhy is sea level rise the best measure of global temperature?  Because the heat capacity of the ocean dwarfs  the heat capacity of the atmosphere by orders of magnitude.  The heat capacity of water is enormous, and the average depth of the ocean 12,000 feet, is roughly on par with the width of the atmosphere which has almost no heat capacity.  When the ocean gets hotter, it expands.  A **much, smaller** cause of the expansion of the oceans, is increased fresh water from melting glaciers (and global warming contributes to that lesser effect too).  **So for all intents and purposes, when you measure the change in volume of the ocean, you measure the entire ocean's change in temperature.**\n\nGlobal warming deniers also have to make a bullshit argument about why increasing CO2 (which has HUGE absorption lines that can easily be distinguished from water's absoroption) won't increase the temperature.  The B.S. argument on 2-bit websites usually says \"the c)2 absorption line is saturated after 12 m, so more CO2, doesn't mean warmer temperatures.  But this isn't true.  The CO2 absorption line doesn't saturate because it's extremely thermally broadened and can absorb off resonant frequencies of light as a result.  Also, as a result, at the Earth's radiation from space, plenty of light is escaping around the CO2 absorption peak, though much less light escapes around the CO2 lines than far from it.  \n\nThe \"science\" behind global warming denial is indistinguishable from the science behind creationism.  It isn't supported by evidence, it uses technical words and scientific jargon, but comes to conclusions that are illogical and unscientific, and that would only be believed by those who haven't put honest, intelligent, critical thought into the process.  \n\nDon't expect the sea level to stop rising.  The only thing that will slow it is to let rain forests re-grow and to stop burning fossil fuels (or to put sulfates in the atmosphere which would cause acid rain and might not help much). \n\nFinally, we came out of an ice age awhile ago.  The ice age was caused by wobbles in the earth's axis, easily predicted by physics, and there's no mystery about why it started, or why it ended.  In the 2000 years before the industrial revolution, the sea level [virtually stopped rising](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Holocene_Sea_Level.png)  Now the sea level is going up more than .3 meters per century.  And if you look at the .2 m rise in sea level in the last 100 years, it agrees with a 1.3 degree C increase in ocean temperature (which averaged over time, because hot water can cycle under water, means a 1.3 degree C rise in atmospheric temperature).",

In a formal detection and attribution analysis using the pooled results from 22 different climate models, the simulated ‚Äúfingerprint‚Äù pattern of anthropogenically caused changes in water vapor is identifiable with high statistical confidence in the SSM/I data.

I've got nothing else to do with them:\n\n>The Antarctic temperature was warmer,and atmospheric CO2 and CH4 concentrations were higher, during interglacials 5.5 and 9.3 than during the Holocene and interglacial 7.5. The temporal evolution and duration of stages 5.5 and 9.3 are indeed remarkably similar for all properties recorded in Vostok ice and entrapped gases. As judged from the Vostok record,the long, stable Holocene is a unique feature of climate during the past 420kyr,with possibly profound implications for evolution and the development of civilizations. Finally, CO2 and CH4 concentrations are strongly correlated with Antarctic temperatures;this is because, overall, our results support the idea that greenhouse gases have contributed significantly to the glacial‚Äìinterglacial change. This correlation, together with the uniquely elevated concentrations of these gases today, is of relevance with respect to the continuing debate on the future of Earth‚Äôs climate.\n\nClimate and atmospheric history of the past 420,000 years from the Vostok ice core, Antarctica J.R.Petit, J.Jouzel, D.Raynaud, N.I.Barkov, J.-M.Barnola, I.Basile, M.Bender, J.Chappellaz, M.Davisk, G.Delaygue, M.Delmotte, V.M.Kotlyakov, M.Legrand, V.Y.Lipenkov, C.Lorius, L.Pepin, C.Ritz, E.Saltzmank & M.Stievenard\n\n>There is good evidence that higher global temperatures will promote a rise of greenhouse gas levels, implying a positive feedback which will increase the effect of anthropogenic emissions on global temperatures. However, the magnitude of this effect predicted by the available models remains highly uncertain, due to the accumulation of uncertainties in the processes thought to be involved. Here we present an alternative way of estimating the magnitude of the feedback effect based on reconstructed past changes. Linking this information with the mid-range Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimation of the greenhouse gas effect on temperature we suggest that the feedback of global temperature on atmospheric CO2 will promote warming by an extra 15‚Äì78% on a century-scale. This estimate may be conservative as we did not account for synergistic effects of likely temperature moderated increase in other greenhouse gases. Our semi-empirical approach independently supports process based simulations suggesting that feedback may cause a considerable boost in warming.\n\nScheffer, M.,V. Brovkin, and P.Cox (2006), Positive feedback between global warming and atmospheric CO2 concentration inferred from past climate change, Geophys. Res.

(1997) that urban effects on 20th century globally and hemispherically averaged land air temperature time-series do not exceed about 0.05¬∞C over the period 1900 to 1990 (assumed here to represent one standard error in the assessed non-urban trends).\n\n>...\n\n>Clearly, the urban heat island effect is a real climate change in urban areas, but is not representative of larger areas. Extensive tests have shown that the urban heat island effects are no more than about 0.05¬∞C up to 1990 in the global temperature records used in this chapter to depict climate change. Thus we have assumed an uncertainty of zero in global land-surface air temperature in 1900 due to urbanisation, linearly increasing to 0.06¬∞C (two standard deviations 0.12¬∞C) in 2000.\n\nClimate Change 2001: Working Group I: The Scientific Basis, Chapter 2. Observed Climate Variability and Change, IPCC Third Assessment Report\n\n>Large-scale increases in the heat content of the world's oceans have been observed to occur over the last 45 years. The horizontal and temporal character of these changes has been closely replicated by the state-of-the-art Parallel Climate Model (PCM) forced by observed and estimated anthropogenic gases. Application of optimal detection methodology shows that the model-produced signals are indistinguishable from the observations at the 0.05 confidence level. Further, the chances of either the anthropogenic or observed signals being produced by the PCM as a result of natural, internal forcing alone are less than 5%. This suggests that the observed ocean heat-content changes are consistent with those expected from anthropogenic forcing, which broadens the basis for claims that an anthropogenic signal has been detected in the global climate system. Additionally, the requirement that modeled ocean heat uptakes match observations puts a strong, new constraint on anthropogenically forced climate models. It is unknown if the current generation of climate models, other than the PCM, meet this constraint.\n\nDetection of Anthropogenic Climate Change in the World's Oceans, Tim P. Barnett, David W.

We compiled the most recent observed climate trends for carbon dioxide concentration, global mean air temperature, and global sea level, and we compare these trends to previous model projections as summarized in the 200 I assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)\n\n>...\n\n>Since 1990 the observed sea level has been rising faster than the rise projected by models, as shown both by a reconstruction using primarily tide gauge data (2) and, since 1993, by satellite altimeter data (3) (both series are corrected for glacial isostatic adjustment). The satellite data show a linear trend of 3.3 ¬± 0.4 mm/year (1993-2006) and the tide gauge reconstruction trend is slightly less, whereas the IPCC projected a best-estimate rise of less than 2 mm/year.\n\n>...\n\n>Overall, these observational data underscore the concems about global climate change.

      "text": "I am not here to convince you otherwise, but to teach you about the science.  First, because I know people will outright downvote me let me explain myself.  There is clearly something strange going on with the global climate.  This is clear.  The questions are how long will it last, what is causing it and what is actually possible to know?\n\nFirst, I will point out that it is not correct that there is unanimous consensus on the cause of climate change.  And you must remember that even scientists are human and when there is money involved (particularly money that puts food on the table) mistakes are more likely to occur and some will overstate things without regard the incredible importance of caution in science.\n\nNext, there are an incredible amount of subtleties that simply are not stated when it comes to presenting the case for anthropogenic climate change -- namely the carbon dioxide argument.  Here I will name three subtleties and encourage that you to investigate this point more.  First, in the list of substances that are greenhouse gases, ordered by radiative forcing, carbon dioxide is not at the top of that list.  Second, we are not at an exceptional point in history when it comes to the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere or temperature.  There are times in history when the global temperature has been much warmer than today and there have been times in history when carbon dioxide was at much higher levels then today.  My third point is the one that unfortunately has gone completely unstated in the public realm--it is a victim of oversimplification.  The climate like the weather and all other natural phenomena is non-linear.  Let me restate that: Everything that we know of is non-linear and the linear approximation that is taught is a simplification of the process that can be worked with and over time it will be entirely inaccurate.  Anyone who has taken high school or college physics has learned the linear equations for a [pendulum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendulum_%28mathematics%29)--they are approximations and give very incorrect answers over a longer length of time.  This sensitivity to initial conditions was first appreciated by a meteorologist at MIT (Lorenz).  What is the weather going to be like in two weeks? Nobody knows.  Now there is a difference between climate and weather, namely that weather is atmospheric variation and climate change is oceanic variation.  But they are both non-linear and the difference in known initial conditions and actual initial conditions creates great differences over a long period of time.  We try our damnedest to predict the weather, but beyond one week it is pointless.  Essentially, we don't know what the readings are between the thermometers and this error becomes so significant one week out that we have no idea what to predict and so we don't.  Now, climate change (with many subtleties) is essentially oceanic variation and since the turbulence is less than the atmosphere we can make predictions beyond a week.  But the claim that the climate can be predicted 100, 50, or even 20 years out is ridiculous.  In fact, the model used is constantly being modified to make it agree with observations.  Also, the funny thing about non-linearity is that it is difficult to say what exactly was the cause.  So, if there is global warming it does not automatically follow what caused it.  I won't say much more, but this last point is where I really am disappointed with the IPCC and their public relations--it is harmful to oversimplify the science for the sake of policy.\n\nNow remember, I do think there is something strange going on...maybe it will turn out to be nothing maybe it will be catastrophic, but I know that nobody in the world actually knows what is going to happen.  This short argument is rather brief and so I encourage you to investigate gas and fluid dynamics and non-linear dynamics on your own.\n\nI am disappointed that so many people who question the IPCC or any of the climate change models are treated like nutjobs or creationists.  It is absolutely important that in science people (especially from different disciplines) can question each other without fear of losing their job or being demoted.  This last summer there was a lot of noise in the APS about climate change and the absolute certainty of some people concerns me.\n\n* http://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/200910/climate.cfm\n\n* http://www.openletter-globalwarming.info/Site/open_letter.html\n\nIn addition, the argument that even if we are wrong about climate change at least we will be using green energy bothers me.  This is not a policy argument it is a scientific question and history will remember lapses in scientific integrity.  There are other ways to promote green energy that do not involve exaggeration and misleading the public.\n\nThis is an incredibly complex problem--probably the most complex scientific problem we have ever looked at and it is important that we get it right.  This includes being honest about the limitations of science, math and the models.\n\n* http://web.mit.edu/esi/symposia/symposium-2009/wunsch.html\n\nThat is all.  Thank you for reading my opinion and not outright downvoting me.  I look forward to learning from the replies.\n\nedit: some links, grammar.\n\nHere are some papers of varying opinion on the uncertainty in climate change predictions to help you get started learning about the hard science of climate change.\n\n* http://eapsweb.mit.edu/research/Lorenz/Climatic_Determinism_1968.pdf\n\n* http://eapsweb.mit.edu/research/Lorenz/Nonlinerity_Weather_Prediction_Climate_Deduction_1966.pdf\n\n* http://eapsweb.mit.edu/research/Lorenz/Predictability_of_28-variable_1965.pdf\n\n* http://eapsweb.mit.edu/research/Lorenz/The_Problem_of_Deducing_1964.pdf\n\n* http://www.seas.harvard.edu/climate/eli/Courses/APM115/2007spring_a/Sources/climate/Hasselmann-1976.pdf\n\n* http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/cats/papersPDFs/66_EvaluatingUncertainty_Nature_2005.pdf\n\n* http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/bibliography/related_files/mallen0001.pdf",

          "text": "If you take the original Lorenz ODE and ask: if I start it in x(0)=z at t=0, where will it be at t=100, that is pretty much impossible to calculate, because tiny numerical errors or a tiny change in x(0) will put x(100) at a completely different point (near the attractor).\n\nBut, and that is the important part, if you ask instead, starting with a \"smooth\" probability distribution around z at t=0 and random influences, what is the probability distribution for x(100), the nonlinear, or rather the chaotic(*), nature of the ODE, doesn't prevent you from rather easily calculating a pretty exact answer.\n\nIndependently of the initial state z, you predict that x(100) will be somewhere on the Lorenz attractor, the chaos doesn't make all answers impossible. The same is true for climate predictions: it's a lot easier to estimate the number of sunny days this year (as a probability distribution) than to predict *which* days exactly will be sunny. Climate research doesn't try to predict the exact trajectory (as you correctly claim, this is impossible even for short time frames) - we don't have enough data, to have the right initial conditions now, and we don't have fast enough computers to use the most exact models - we don't include tiny models of cars driving and models of the making decisions if they should drive to McDonalds or build a factory near the river. Instead these unpredictable factors are simulated by random influences. Then we run 100s or 1000s of simulations - each time the random influences and the random inital state (that could have lead to the climate data we have today) will be different,  -  to see what can be expected to be possible outcomes. \n\n*: nonlinearity itself is not the problem, there are plenty of non-chaotic nonlinear systems (called integrable systems in some contexts). Lorenz' findings had a huge impact in the 1970s, but it's the 2010's now, the specialists know the limits.",

      "text": "Hi, lots of other responses but I'll have a go at replying directly to some key points. First of all, good on you for asking the question. I'd happily provide my criteria for what would cause me *not* to believe in AGW, had anyone asked :)\n\n> Scientists are attempting to predict what will happen to the climate in the future. They do so in two ways. 1) To look at past climate data, and extrapolate trends.\n\nThis doesn't really happen. Sometimes scientists will look at past climate for hints, but they generally use it to set upper or lower bounds on behaviour, and those bounds are usually pretty loose. Part of the problem is that we have only very sketchy ideas of what past climate actually was, and have to use proxy methods that become increasingly unreliable the further you go into the past.\n\nTherefore, scientists look to the historical record more for confirmation than prediction. If climate models couldn't reproduce ice ages (and there was a time they couldn't, back in the 90s), then you'd know there were serious problems somewhere. If they can, that's a bit more evidence that you're probably closer to a good understanding of the climate. \n\n> If we take the best models we have now, of how climate changes.... and then apply those models to data from the 1970's, do we emerge with accurate predictions of global weather in the 90's? Such a thing would convert me instantly.\n\nWell, it shouldn't convert you \"instantly,\" unless you have a full understanding of how the model works. I'm sure someone's already posted this, but the last IPCC report has a [full chapter](http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch8.html) on what models are, how they work and what they show. You might be particularly interested in the graph on [this page](http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/faq-8-1.html), which shows exactly what you're looking for: 14 different models, run 58 times in total, given our best estimates of all the forcings for the past century (eg volcanic eruptions, solar changes, and greenhouse gases). They correlate pretty well with the actual temperatures. Again, I emphasize that this isn't _proof_ that the models are correct, but they can, at the very least, replicate past changes in climate.\n\n> And all of this still doesn't show that the warming is anthropogenic. \n\nIf you take out the anthropogenic forcings and re-run the models, you get [this](http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/syr/en/figure-2-5.html). Part of that graph is a simplified version of the previous graph I linked to.\n\n> There's a lot of good skeptical literature on this subject, a good 15% of it isn't even written by crazies on the internet. \n\nUnfortunately, very little of it is peer-reviewed, or is peer-reviewed in very low-quality journals such as Energy and Environment. (I can justify this \"low-quality\" claim if you like).\n\nHope some of this helps!",

      "text": "It seems that I'm too late to have serious input here after reading the OP updates. However, I will still give my input.\n\n[Skepticism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skepticism) is generally a good thing. It is at the core of science. That is different from [denialism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denialism). There are a lot of deniers who do not bother to even look at the supporting evidence but decide on the outcome they want and cling to whatever main principle they think supports their position. \n\nIt seems very clear that you are a skeptic, not a denier. You just happen to be one for whom the sum of the evidence seems to bounce you back and forth a little. I too have fit that description. For a long time I thought the evidence was weak (and it was weaker) and tended to lean towards it not being a real concern. When it became apparent to me that this wasn't fringe science -- that this was taken seriously in the scientific literature -- then I actually took a serious look at the evidence. Not news reports or activist blogs, but actual scientific papers and detailed summaries. I also sought out evidence against it.\n\nWhat I found was that virtually all of the scientific work was consistent and pointed towards it being true. Objections tended to be from non-scientists and using non-peer-reviewed methods and arguments (many of which I could personally find flaws in). Some were laughably naive, at least with even a cursory understanding of how global warming works.\n\nThat isn't to say it was, or is, a slam dunk. It is virtually impossible to deny that the Earth is actually warming, though there are those still trying. While some of these objections do provide legitimate concerns to be addressed -- and they have been -- they do not provide evidence *against* global warming, only bring into question the degree of certainty of the measurements used. However, many independent measurement techniques all point to the same thing. There is consistency.\n\n*Anthropogenic* causes are more difficult to demonstrate. I have serious problems with the way some material is presented. Al Gore's *An Inconvenient Truth* documentary (I haven't read the book) doesn't give a single argument as to a human cause. It is merely assumed or implied. The one place he implies it is the Vostok data where he shows historically over hundreds of thousands of years that carbon dioxide and temperatures are highly correlated. He even mocks skeptics (rather, he means *deniers*) by showing how obvious it is that the CO2 and temperature graphs fit together. The main problem with this is that the CO2 graph *lags* the temperature graph by about 800 years, which you can't see at the scale he uses. I've downloaded the data myself and done the correlation analysis, and indeed the correlation is smoothly highest with an 890 year lag. So you can't use this correlation to demonstrate that CO2 *causes* warming. Rather, it implies the opposite. (Of course, the correlation and lag is reasonably well understood and it is a feedback system, after all. CO2 *can* raise the temperature, releasing more CO2, raising the temp again, etc., until some equilibrium is reached since the relationship is non-linear.)\n\nAdditionally, I had concerns about models. I had used models extensively in my Masters and PhD work, and even at my job in the decade since. I know full well the limitations of models as far as accurate predictions. FIrst, you need independent data to calibrate the model. Second, you can't extrapolate very far outside the calibrated region. Neither is easy for climate models. Third, you need to do sensitivity analysis and error propagation. What are the error bars on the predictions? I still haven't seen a good presentation of this work. (Can anybody point me to some?)\n\nHowever, these objections are only in terms of accuracy of predicted *values*, not behaviour or trends. Accurate *behaviour* modeling is still quite important. Even my grad research models were to characterize system behavioural modes. And in this respect, climate models do a pretty good job. They only need to demonstrate that the models show the right trends and magnitudes given a set of circumstances. And they do that well. \n\nAs I investigated I slowly moved to the \"this is a real concern\" side of probability. Part of it was realizing the consistency of the *scientific* data, both empirical and model-based. What makes for a good scientific theory is both empirical evidence and a well-understood mechanism by which it occurs. This is the basis for essentially all good science, medicine, reasoning, and even law. (For example, evidence that somebody commited a crime, the means by which they did it, and a motive are very convincing and increase the probability of a correct decision.)\n\nWe have all of these for climate science. That is, there is empirical evidence the Earth is warming. There is evidence it is warming in high correlation with CO2 (and other GHG) emissions. There is a well-understood mechanism by which the CO2, in amounts measured, *should* cause warming in the amounts measured. To put it simply, the best explanation we have says APW is real.\n\nDoes that make it 100% certain? No. But given the above, what *would* convince you of AGW? The remarks of having the models provide accurate predictions for today's climate doesn't answer the question. As I outline above, that's a precision measurement issue, not a trend one. If you are traveling up a hill at constant velocity and predict where you'll be in 1 minute, but then slow down or speed up, the fact your exact prediction was wrong doesn't change the fact you are going up a hill or *why* you are going up a hill.\n\nA second tack on the problem of deciding what to believe is what justifies the assumption that warming is *not* anthropogenic? The immediate tendency is to refer to the burden of proof, saying that anyone making the claim needs to demonstrate it. And that is true. It is simply misapplied. The default position is \"I don't know\", not the negation of the claim. Any lack of evidence that there is AGW is *not* evidence for the claim that there is *no* AGW.  To make the claim that AGW is not real, or a concern, the burden of proof is on those who make that claim as much as those who say it is real and a concern.  \n\nIf you look at it in terms of certainty, it can run from -1 to +1, where -1 means absolute certainty that APW is not real, +1 is absolute certainty it is real, and 0 means \"I don't know\". *That* is the default position. And when looking at the evidence, I have found that there is a lot more on the positive side than the negative side. Uncertainty tends to weaken the strength of evidence towards zero (but not towards -1), but it is still on the positive side. I'm not sure where I'd place the certainty myself, probably somewhere around +0.5, but no matter how much you don't agree in the strength of the evidence for it, I can't imagine how anyone could put it on the negative side, suggesting it isn't a concern.\n\nAnother tack is consensus. No, not popular consensus of *opinion*. That misrepresentation is common. Rather, *scientific consensus* is essential to science. Scientific consensus is the agreement of *results* towards a particular conclusion. It is not the opinion of the scientists. Some (like Michael Crichton) argue that good science can be a single scientist doing good work. Fine, but that's moot and relies on dual meanings of \"good science\". If there is an enormous amount of scientific support for a particular theory or conclusion, a single paper that disagrees, no matter how well done, cannot overturn the scientific consensus. That would be bad science. The discrepancy first needs to be understood. Any new theory needs to explain the results of the past support, and the results of the new work need to be repeatable and understood. In that context, the scientific consensus (as well as popular consensus) is that global warming is real and anthropogenic CO2 is very likely a major contributor. Suggesting otherwise, without a massive amount of evidence to explain away these results, is irrational.\n\nFinally, my reasoning goes one step beyond that. Not everybody has the background or time to read or study all of the scientific literature or summaries. When it comes down to it, on what basis is it rational to believe one person versus another? Shouldn't expertise tilt it to one side? Shouldn't the fact that climate scientists do this for a living give them a little more benefit of the doubt than some politician, pundit, businessman, talk show host, or your barber?\n\nI mean, do these people think they've actually outsmarted climate scientists on climate science, despite having done no climate research themselves, no training in the area, and usually not even having read any of the science? When someone suggests it is a natural cycle, do they think that they've just had a brilliant thought that climate scientists missed and haven't considered? It amazed me the hubris of some of these deniers.\n\nUltimately, that is the purpose of experts. We all are not equal when it comes to knowledge in certain areas. People who do it for a living and are trained in it *are* demonstrably better at it, and their conclusions *do* matter and hold more weight than those who don't do it for a living. That doesn't mean they are always right. It means that the probability leans towards them being *more* right than somebody who is not an expert. And the more of them that agree (yes, even popular consensus), the more believable the conclusion should be for those who do not have the expertise nor the time to understand the actual work. Expertise *does* count for something in the is world, and for good reason.",

      "text": "I could describe myself as in a similar position to the original poster. I do not fit the collective Internet unconscious image of a \"climate skeptic,\" but I find myself skeptical of the scientific consensus around AGW. For what it's worth, here are a few things that smell funniest to me about the AGW hypothesis, as an admitted non-expert:\n\n1. Reliance on computer models. From my experience building software, no complex software is *proven* correct, and software never works the first time; you fix bugs until it appears to work well enough. What happens when you apply this process to software whose purpose is to produce data for academic publication? How do we know that, though acting in perfectly good faith, the research team did not in essence \"fix bugs\" until the software produced the results they expected, and then stop? The illusion that \"the computer\" is giving you the result, rather than a fallible human being, can cover some pernicious cognitive biases.\n\n2. The Lucas Critique (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_critique). Since there are opportunistic agents (namely, living things, not limited to human beings) affecting the balance of CO2 and other determinants of climate, a parameter-fitting approach to predicting the climate might be just as naive as the parameter-fitting approach to predicting economic paths. I would be grateful for any references to a dialog that explores the possible isomorphism between 90's/'00's climate modeling and '60's/'70's macroeconomic modeling.\n\n3. Unfalsifiability. It does not seem to matter whether we have a colder or hotter decade in the '10's than we did in the 'aughts, nor whether sea levels rise or fall, or ice caps expand or recede; every possible outcome can only increase our confidence in AGW. Let's read our Popper and make some falsifiable predictions, like all other useful theories. E.g.: \"Given X teratons of human CO2 emissions, we should expect measurable quantitative outcome Y, *and if that does not happen something is very wrong with our theory*.\" I see the \"X and Y\" part from time to time, but much less of the italicised part.\n\n(Just to clarify: this is distinct from the naive \"oh, it snowed today, global warming fail, ha ha\" talk radio schtick. Average temperature in a decade can fairly be called \"climate,\" not \"weather\".)",

The short answer is \"yes, they do that, we do.\" \n\nThe long answer is \"Well, yeah...\" They do, and we _mostly_ do, but climate models are incredibly complicated, because the climate is a very complicated system with myriad interactions of feedback loops. Retrospective forecasting is partially used just to calibrate climate models -- you get it so your model *does* accurately predict the known weather in the past, and then you run it foreward. \n\nOne such model is located here:\nhttp://nomad6.ncep.noaa.gov/\nAnd if you want to try and play around with it, you can. They include all the source code and the datasets. They include an article about what the CFS is. If you can build it and run it, then maybe you can actually educate yourself on what's going on. \n\nBut honestly, I'm not sure that you can hope to understand it. I certainly can't understand it. You'll note that they don't provide technical support to teach you how to use it; they don't have time for that and they don't get paid for that. **I really think that we ought to be investing some money in being able to do true, good educational outreach on this.** But it makes sense that there's not the money and time for that kind of venture. \n\nThis kind of work takes expertise. That creates jargon. The jargon doesn't exist to lock you out. The jargon exists because at these high levels of expertise, they cannot hope to communicate quickly without it. I am sure that you are also expert in something highly specialized, and have a difficult time explaining it in detail to amateurs. \n\n**tl;dr** Here is a climate change model you can play with, if you can figure it out. \n\n*edit* After consideration, it appears that this might be a seasonal forecasting model, and *not* a climate change model.",

The end-result is an empirical probability distribution that hopefully reflects how likely which scenario is. [some models](http://www.ncar.ucar.edu/tools/models/modelslist.php)\n\nIf for 95% of your runs the global temperature rises by something between 1.5 and 4 degrees, with mode at 2.3 degrees, over a century, there might still be 0.5% runs where global temperature decreases. (numbers here are invented) So - assuming the model is reasonably correct - there would still be a chance we wouldn't see a rise in global temperature for the next century.\n\nAlso, these climate models are far from perfect, there are many yet little understood mechanisms, and modern super computers are still so slow that they put serious constraints on how sophisticated the models can become. A big part of [research](http://www.cisl.ucar.edu/research/) consists in finding out which simplifications are possible without compromising the results and in improving the algorithms for these simulations.\n\n>If we take the best models we have now, of how climate changes.... and then apply those models to data from the 1970's, do we emerge with accurate predictions of global weather in the 90's? Such a thing would convert me instantly.\n\nOf course, the models behave more or less (remember, most have random elements) like the historic data, if only because there are enough parameters that can be adjusted. That's no sign of the correctness. But for this reason, simulations with lots of different \"possible\"(according to todays knowledge) parameters are tested. Obviously you can vary the amount of human generated green house gases in these models, so  - assuming the models are reasonable approximations of reality - there is no doubt left that the warming is  anthropogenic.\n\nOf course, global warming is a bit of a gamble: There is a small chance that today's models are missing an essential part that makes the green house effect irrelevant. Or it's possible that other yet not considered effects will offset the human created increase in temperatures. But it's also possible that some things nobody thought about yet will make the climate change much more catastrophical.\n\n>Also, please don't appeal to consensus\n\nYou won't get more certainty than that, that's the nature of the problem, sorry. Unless you have a supercomputer, a staff of scientists, mathematicians etc and your own climate data collection, at some point\nyou'll have to trust in the integrity of someone else. That's the Achilles‚Äô heel the deniers have found: just claim that 98% of the world's climate researchers are corrupt!\n\nThe idea that climate researchers are \"faking\" global warming for the money is ridiculous. There is more money to be made in shorter term climate models, aka three months to a few years, predicting droughts, hurricanes, expected number of sunny days for a region etc. There are weather derivatives, reinsurance etc. There is even more money to be made protecting industry interests against environmental regulations.",

CRU produces the land component, with the Met Office Hadley Centre producing the marine component. \r\n\r\nTemperature data for the period 1860-1880 are more uncertain, because of sparser coverage, than for later periods in the 20th Century. The 1860-1880 period is also only 21 years in length. As for the two periods 1910-40 and 1975-1998 the warming rates are not statistically significantly different (see numbers below). \r\n\r\nI have also included the trend over the period 1975 to 2009, which has a very similar trend to the period 1975-1998. \r\n\r\nSo, in answer to the question, the warming rates for all 4 periods are similar and not statistically significantly different from each other. \r\n\r\nHere are the trends and significances for each period:Period\tLength\tTrend \r\n(Degrees C per decade)\tSignificance\r\n1860-1880\t21\t0.163\tYes\r\n1910-1940\t31\t0.15\tYes\r\n1975-1998\t24\t0.166\tYes\r\n1975-2009\t35\t0.161\tYes\r\n\r\n\r\nB - Do you agree that from 1995 to the present there has been no statistically-significant global warming\r\n\r\nYes, but only just. I also calculated the trend for the period 1995 to 2009. This trend (0.12C per decade) is positive, but not significant at the 95% significance level. The positive trend is quite close to the significance level. Achieving statistical significance in scientific terms is much more likely for longer periods, and much less likely for shorter periods.",

When considering changes over this period we need to consider all possible factors (so human and natural influences as well as natural internal variability of the climate system). Natural influences (from volcanoes and the Sun) over this period could have contributed to the change over this period. Volcanic influences from the two large eruptions (El Chichon in 1982 and Pinatubo in 1991) would exert a negative influence. Solar influence was about flat over this period. Combining only these two natural influences, therefore, we might have expected some cooling over this period.\r\n\r\nH - If you agree that there were similar periods of warming since 1850 to the current period, and that the MWP is under debate, what factors convince you that recent warming has been largely man-made?\r\n\r\nThe fact that we can't explain the warming from the 1950s by solar and volcanic forcing - see my answer to your question D.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: A:The rate of change has manifested throughout the 120 years of temperature tracking and show no discernible difference in rate of change during the warming periods. D: I don't know Geo-physical science very well or the range of natural phenomena that cause global warming but if we ONLY LOOK at sun and volcano data it maybe should have gone down maybe H: Going from my lack of knowledge on Geo-physics we can only assume its man made.",

It's one of the ways to standardly test a model and is called hindcasting.  For example, see [this figure](http://www.grida.no/publications/other/ipcc%5Ftar/?src=/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/figspm-4.htm) from an IPCC report.  There's a lot of data on this if you are interested, you could start with [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_climate_model#Accuracy_of_models_that_predict_global_warming), which will point you to the relevant IPCC reports., which will point you to the relevant primary literature (PM me if you need access to the journal articles).",

      "text": "If you don't see yourself as a scientist qualified to analyze climate change, surely the combination of a scientific consensus along with an understanding of the science that goes into said consensus should be enough to make one believe in the theory, at least until you see evidence to the contrary. If this is not enough for you, then I would suggest that you aren't actually interested in science. I'm going to assume that you are.\n\nI'm also going to assume that you are not going to argue about the existence of scientific consensus for climate change. If you are, then, again, there's not much hope for you.\n\nFrom this all that is left is for you is to understand the science behind the theory of climate change as well as you can. What level of understanding you feel satisfied with is up to you, but I am only guessing that trying to parse all the data related to climate change is a little over your head. It'd be willing to bet that it's well over the head of any climate specialist, even. I would argue that in the end the data on global warming is only the least bit relevant if you can understand the physics behind it.\n\nSo, do you think you can trust the data regarding increased level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_in_Earth%27s_atmosphere\n\nThis is based on fairly simple measurements that are not subject to the kind of heavy interpretation of climate predictions. If you believe this data, and believe in the greenhouse effect (which is the basis of so many theories and which is so easily observable that I imagine you do) then you already believe that the earth is absorbing an increasing amount of energy from the sun. For this argument it doesn't really matter what the source of this increase in CO2 is, but I think we can agree that we as a species output a retardedly large amount of it.\n\nSo, since we know about the laws of thermodynamics, we know that this increase in energy into the earth means that the earth is storing this energy somehow. I'm not so sure about this, but I have no reason to believe that the majority of this energy is being converted to matter, in which case this energy is being stored as either heat, or kinetic energy, or both. Any combination of this energy storage is bound to have an effect of some degree on the climate, because that's more or less what the climate is: heat and kinetic energy in our atmosphere.\n\nIf you've followed me this far, then there clearly is something happening to the climate. Question is: how much is happening? Well, is it measurable? Based on all kinds of data that other people have pointed out, it would seem that climate change is measurable and it is behaving in a way that is consistent with what we know about the greenhouse effect.\n\nAnd *that* is exactly what is important. It's not simply that people are \"measuring\" climate change. It's that the measurements that are being taken do not contradict, and in fact support, the science that I'm sure you already understood about the greenhouse effect, along with the increased presence of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\n\nFor me - as someone who is certainly not an expert - this knowledge is enough to make me believe in global warming. If I've made any logical errors, then I would enjoy hearing about them. If you believe all of the things I've said and still don't believe in global warming, then I'd like to know what you think science is and why it differs so much from what I believe science to be.",

The analysis of the data sets used to create these graphs is very complex and there are a lot of factors to consider. For example, how do they compensate for the urban heat island or other statistically significant factors? My point is that although these links illustrate a lot of consensus from some very respectable organizations on this issue, they leave some important issues raised by the OP unanswered. How successful are these climate models at predicting/explaining our current climate conditions? We always have to be wary of extrapolating based on an incomplete data set. Also, our understanding of our environment is far from complete and we certainly don't understand all of the feedback mechanisms that may or may not be present. What I mean by all of this is that though these sites are informative and useful, they don't conclusively prove to me that global warming is caused by humans. I should note that I am in favor of cutting emissions and environmental responsibility. I just want to see some of the hard science behind this before I can firmly support the statement that humans are causing global warming. Then again, I am sure that many of the research papers on which these findings are based are publicly available, so I guess I have no right to whine until I do more research.",

          "text": "Weather != Climate.  Both are complex, but when you talk about chaos and meteorologists, you're talking about weather.  While predicting whether it will rain ten days from now is fiendishly complex, predicting that it will be warm in Chicago in July is not. That's not to say we have perfect climate models -- we don't. But conflating short term specific predictions with finding long term trends is a favorite pastime of both the ignorant and those with an agenda on this issue.\n\nTo your second point, it's unfortunate, but we're in the middle of a highly complex scientific endeavor here, and you aren't going to find one guy somewhere who discovered and proved AGW and published his data in a 20 page journal article. It's a lot messier than that. There are hundreds of different research groups, each working in specific areas, and the whole picture, or at least what we have of it, arises only from the union of all of this work. The data is widely dispersed and often contradictory. However, that doesn't mean that the idea is wrong. It's the way science works. Multiple people work, get together, collaborate, figure out each other's problems, toss out mistaken ideas, back up three steps, etc. The lack of a single \"conclusive study\" isn't necessarily evidence of much of anything at this point.\n\nWhich brings me to the first point. What you're looking at is a short explanation intended for a popular lay audience. The very nature of the medium is that you aren't going to have a 500 entry bibliography referring to highly technical scientific papers. I'm sure that if you were to ask the folks at NASA or any other qualified research lab, they could point you to hundreds of peer reviewed journal articles to support dozens of claims made in the text. You just can't look at what is essentially a press release, and from the lack of citations, assume that the citations don't exist.\n\nNotice that at no point have I weighed in on your skepticism, which may well be a reasonable position, but the evidence you've cited isn't very compelling. I do disagree with your insinuation that both sides are equally full of it.  It's certainly complex, and there are reasons to be suspicious, but, to dramatically oversimplify things, 50 climatologists in favor and 50 cattle farmers opposed does not make a draw.  It's not actually that difficult to find \"everyday scientists\" who are willing to talk about their work. I worked with a whole group of them about eight years ago, and AGW was not a terribly controversial subject to them.  Sure, there are a tremendous number of holes, and the details aren't well understood, but much like evolution, there can be disagreement over the details without casting doubt on the overall theory, although AGW is certainly not as well founded as evolutionary theory at this point.",

In the past few months, there was a big retraction / scandal in my field (biochemistry / chemical biology). One of the bigwigs (Peter Schultz) had to retract a Science paper because it turns out that the data was bunk, nobody could reproduce it, and the data turned out to be fundamentally impossible due to some technical reasons. The paper still made it through the peer review process to make it into Science, one of the most respected scientific journals. \n\nDoes that mean that we should stop believing that biochemistry is real? Of course not. Should peer review have caught the mistake before it was published? Maybe, but it probably isn't a realistic expectation that every mistake will be caught. It was found later, and the article is now no more. That's how science works. Some stuff slips through the cracks of peer review, no matter how good the system is set up to be. If it's an important detail, there's a very high chance that it will be discovered at some later point.",

If you haven't looked at the data you think something for no reason.)\n\nI think I have read 18 or the UN version of it I think before.

It should be clear that there is a lot of work to be done still...\n\nEDIT: On data. Like I said if you don't look at the data you don't have a reason for believing something. Let me also add some tips for the non-scientists trying to look at data. When looking at data, think is there some way this data could be plotted that would look less convincing, or even say the opposite thing. You'll be surprised how often the answer is yes. Never trust data without error bars unless you understand the experiment well enough to know the errors are just too small to show.\n\nAs an example. Take the first plot in (2) http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/globalwarming/ar4-fig-3-6.gif\nIt is fluctuations about a mean value, what is that mean value? It is the integrated mean of 1961-1990. Is there any window that would make it look more like noise? (Hint -0.2 C as 0 might lead to a slightly less strong argument for those not looking carefully at all of the data).",

This is the entire point behind peer reviewed science -- it allows us as non-specialists to have a certain base level of certainty in the published results of specialists, without having to invest an entire career in the field.  A lot of the hyperbole coming from global warming denialists is the result of the opposite perspective -- that \"common sense\" is sufficient to comprehend and refute the opinions of experts.  This ranges from \"it's warm in my neighbourhood\" arguments that you get from complete jackasses like Beck and co, to \"I'm an expert in short term climate, so I know climatology\" that you get from TV weathermen (and women).",

The same is true for climate predictions: it's a lot easier to estimate the number of sunny days this year (as a probability distribution) than to predict *which* days exactly will be sunny. Climate research doesn't try to predict the exact trajectory (as you correctly claim, this is impossible even for short time frames) - we don't have enough data, to have the right initial conditions now, and we don't have fast enough computers to use the most exact models - we don't include tiny models of cars driving and models of the making decisions if they should drive to McDonalds or build a factory near the river. Instead these unpredictable factors are simulated by random influences. Then we run 100s or 1000s of simulations - each time the random influences and the random inital state (that could have lead to the climate data we have today) will be different,  -  to see what can be expected to be possible outcomes. \n\n*: nonlinearity itself is not the problem, there are plenty of non-chaotic nonlinear systems (called integrable systems in some contexts).

When considering changes over this period we need to consider all possible factors (so human and natural influences as well as natural internal variability of the climate system). Natural influences (from volcanoes and the Sun) over this period could have contributed to the change over this period. Volcanic influences from the two large eruptions (El Chichon in 1982 and Pinatubo in 1991) would exert a negative influence. Solar influence was about flat over this period.

      "text": "There can be **absolutely no doubt that the earth is getting dramatically warmer.** The best measure of the Earth's increase in temperature is to [measure the current sea level rise.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_sea_level_rise)  The sea level has been rising in a virtually straight line for the last century (when CO2 levels have been increasing in an almost straight line but with slight upward parabolic corrections to slope).  The sea level has risen at a 1-2 mm a year this century, and this was observed before anyone knew that humans were increasing CO2 levels.  Recent, much more accurate, satellite altimetry shows that the sea level has been rising in a straight line for the last decade plus, but at a higher rate of 3 cm /decade.  This rate is expected to increase dramatically as warmer temperatures from CO2 put more water vapor and methane greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere. For example, the presence of a large, warm El Nino this year lead to reliable predictions in the fall that CA and the East Coast would have an extremely wet late winter and summer (more evaporation off of a hot El Nino means more precipitation at colder latitudes), and that the NW U.S. would be warm and dry.   \n\nBoth global warming deniers and some alarmists love to cherry pick extremely sparse surface temperature data, and sea surface temperature data, to justify their theories.  Since some parts of the world are getting colder, and some parts of the world are expected to get much colder due to global warming (especially the NE U.S. and Europe), we can't rely on these point measurements. \n\nTo explain the rise of the sea level data (while denying the nearly 1:1 .99 correlation with increases in CO2) deniers have to both invent new physics to deny the physics behind the greenhouse effect, and then blame the warming on something else (usually the sun).  Yes, the brightness of the sun does fluctuate very slightly with the sunspot cycle.   This small fluctuation of intensity is largely absent in the sea level rise data, other than squiggles on a rising straight line.  [Here is a bullshit graph that uses non-sea-level temperature data on a global warming denier website](http://icecap.us/images/uploads/PDOAMOTEMP.jpg) In the first place, notice their huge fluctuations in temperature data that are almost absent the very substantial and linear rise in sea level data.  There should be large fluctuations in surface temperature data because it's a profoundly inaccurate measure of temperature.  This graph's temperature data is wrong, because it disagrees with sea level data.  And there's no evidence (off of climate denier websites) of some profound and regular (hugely long period oscillation of the sun's temperature... we have sunspot data going back to Newton's time).  So these kinds of graphs have manage to line up two dubious datasets and make them match.  Bullshit in-> dubious fit comes out.  \n\nWhy is sea level rise the best measure of global temperature?  Because the heat capacity of the ocean dwarfs  the heat capacity of the atmosphere by orders of magnitude.  The heat capacity of water is enormous, and the average depth of the ocean 12,000 feet, is roughly on par with the width of the atmosphere which has almost no heat capacity.  When the ocean gets hotter, it expands.  A **much, smaller** cause of the expansion of the oceans, is increased fresh water from melting glaciers (and global warming contributes to that lesser effect too).  **So for all intents and purposes, when you measure the change in volume of the ocean, you measure the entire ocean's change in temperature.**\n\nGlobal warming deniers also have to make a bullshit argument about why increasing CO2 (which has HUGE absorption lines that can easily be distinguished from water's absoroption) won't increase the temperature.  The B.S. argument on 2-bit websites usually says \"the c)2 absorption line is saturated after 12 m, so more CO2, doesn't mean warmer temperatures.  But this isn't true.  The CO2 absorption line doesn't saturate because it's extremely thermally broadened and can absorb off resonant frequencies of light as a result.  Also, as a result, at the Earth's radiation from space, plenty of light is escaping around the CO2 absorption peak, though much less light escapes around the CO2 lines than far from it.  \n\nThe \"science\" behind global warming denial is indistinguishable from the science behind creationism.  It isn't supported by evidence, it uses technical words and scientific jargon, but comes to conclusions that are illogical and unscientific, and that would only be believed by those who haven't put honest, intelligent, critical thought into the process.  \n\nDon't expect the sea level to stop rising.  The only thing that will slow it is to let rain forests re-grow and to stop burning fossil fuels (or to put sulfates in the atmosphere which would cause acid rain and might not help much). \n\nFinally, we came out of an ice age awhile ago.  The ice age was caused by wobbles in the earth's axis, easily predicted by physics, and there's no mystery about why it started, or why it ended.  In the 2000 years before the industrial revolution, the sea level [virtually stopped rising](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Holocene_Sea_Level.png)  Now the sea level is going up more than .3 meters per century.  And if you look at the .2 m rise in sea level in the last 100 years, it agrees with a 1.3 degree C increase in ocean temperature (which averaged over time, because hot water can cycle under water, means a 1.3 degree C rise in atmospheric temperature).",

Maybe you might like to reconsider that stance?\n\nMy response to you is not to deny the warming is happening, nor to debate the why of it either. That would be pointless - \"Internet Style\".\n\nPerhaps you might like to consider these facts and respond again:\n\n1) We are not a type 1 civilisation on the Kardashev scale. Look it up. It will likely be 100 years or more until we approach that point.\n\n2) We do not know what effect attempting to change our atmosphere will have. We *think* we know, but thinking doesn't cut it when consider spending 100 TRILLION dollars.\n\n3) To date, no model has successfully predicted existing conditions from ANY point in the past. How can you have any confidence in predicting climate effects when we start to twiddle?\n\n4) Of all global warming gasses, water vapour is the most dominant. Yet our models are incapable of modelling with sufficient granularity to handle this fact. I ask again - how can you have confidence in predictions made from models that do not work?\n\n5) The dollars we spend (Trillions of them) to directly reduce CO2 output are an unknown spending - we can't predict what will happen when we reduce our output - exactly. However, we known down the last cent the exact output of measures designed to alleviate the warming. These are known returns on investment. How can you justify spending trillions on one thing of unknown value when half that amount would more than offset the effects of the warming to a large degree?\n\n6) The energy generating business (since we invented fire) has been on a rapid downward spiral of C02 emitted per watt of energy generated. Not once has any technology been subsidised to move to a lower CO2 output, and yet the trend is universally down. No legislation has been required. It's just more efficient and makes more money. When Fusion power arrives (and it will, and soon) the output per watt will be unmeasurable, so, instead of spending trillions on prevention when the economics of it do not make sense, how about spending 1% of that on Fusion research and development? Then you simply don't have to worry at all. Ever.\n\n7) If you asked a Londoner of 1900 what the most pressing problems of London in the year 2000 would be, their answer would universally be: \"How will you source 20 million horses, and how will you get rid of that much shit every day?\" We can easily see the assumption is silly from 2010, because technology leaves old problems behind, and creates a set of whole new problems to deal with. For us to say Global Warming will be the most important issue in 2100 is extreme hubris, and flies in the face of reason. I would argue that the most pressing problem facing the world today is supplying fresh drinking water to every person alive, and that this is far more important than worrying about GW in any shape or form. What's your take on THAT? Because for a tiny (and I do mean tiny) fraction of the 100 trillion dollars would supply everlasting drinking water for all mankind.\n\n8) The Carbon trading system is a pure (but complicated) scam and is one of the largest crimes ever perpetuated in my view. How can the public have confidence in ANY scheme which involves hundreds of billions of dollars and is almost entirely corrupt?\n\n9) If you had the choice of providing clean drinking water to you and your family now and in the future, or spending that same money on trying to \"prevent\" (LOL) GW, what would YOU do?\n\n10) The climate of Earth has always been changing, and it will never stop changing. It will, over time, ALWAYS get hotter, until the sun bakes the rocks dry on the surface and finally engulfs the planet entirely as a red giant. In what way do you think a Type 0 civilisation can even hope to achieve anything so massive as to control the atmosphere, and hence the climate of an entire planet?\n\n11) Examining the dire consequences of ice ages - which can approach with incredible speed - and the relatively benign effects of rising temperatures - how can you even worry at all about warming? Man, an ice age would wipe the surface clean of us instantly in geological time - and in less than a lifetime, if it began again now. With this in mind, how can you defend wanting to take ANY action which would even slow down the warming? It is certainly true that the farming of the world will evolve dramatically as a result of climate change and warming, and for every acre which is devastated, another acre of productive land will arise somewhere else. This will tip the balance of earnings to the warming lands in northern and southern latitudes for sure, but we have the technology to continue farming by using water better, and controlling its use more effectively. Why should we do anything at all to prevent any of this? We are more than capable of adapting to the changes. Humans have demonstrated repeatedly that we are the most adaptable animal ever to arise on this planet, and we occupy every niche on the planet bar the floors of oceans. In what way do you feel that humans are incapable of adequately adapting to a changing world? Bearing in mind we have been doing it for better than 1.5 million years already.\n\n12) Like many problems facing humanity, you are looking at (potential) 22nd century problems with early 21st century technology and knowledge. You do not account for the fact that from 2000 to 2010 humans added as much knowledge to our total store as from 1900 to 2000. It will double again between 2010 and 2020. Then it will double again, shortly thereafter. The best example I can think of is the \"idiots\" who began sequencing the human genome. The equipment they used would not (and could not) have completed the task in 1000 years, but they continued, because they KNEW that technology would provide machines which would quickly finish what took so long to even start to make a dent in. As it turned out they finished long before even the optimists thought they possibly could. You must have faith in advances in human knowledge - and in technology you can't even imagine now. In 1900 the best minds in the world could not foresee lasers, radar, computers in your hand, and thousands of other technologies which transformed the planet completely in less than 100 years.\n\nThe changes in technology and science in the NEXT 100 years will be even more remarkable. \n\nMy personal feeling is that doing anything at all to prevent climate change is a complete and utter waste of time, as the planet does not have a \"tipping\" point. The world has not been \"iceball Earth\" in over 600 million years, and it was Co2 that saved the planet back then. Since that time, the ratio of gasses in our atmosphere has swung WILDLY, and yet the planet never died, and ice ages, while some have been extreme, have never spun the earth into a run-away ANYTHING. The feedback mechanisms of this planet are fierce and powerful - and we still do not understand them properly at all.\n\nBasically, I'm saying that we should spend money on things we KNOW the outcome of, and quit being so fucking terrified (which is what the powers want you to be. No fear = no control) of things that *might* happen. Humans are filled with hubris, and thinking we can control our planet's climate is the greatest and worst example ever of humanity's delusional behaviour.\n\nWe will get there one day, but that day is a while away yet.",

How can you have any confidence in predicting climate effects when we start to twiddle?\n\nBullshit. Scientific models predict things that will happen in the future all the time.  That's what they're supposed to do.  For an example, see the wikipedia page on sea level rise.  You imply that scientists couldn't predict that new satellite altimetry measurements would find a future rise in sea level.  Scientists did predict a **future** rise in sea level, based on scientific models and past observations, and observed exactly this.  \n\nFor another example in the post: when scientists observe El Nino forming in the Pacific in the Fall, they can predict what kind of weather we'll have next winter vs. the average.  It's not magic, it's not homeopathy, it's science.\n\nIn contrast, non-scientist global warming deniers constantly take 3 years of data and predict a lasting cooling trend.  Guess who's predictions turn out to be wrong?\n\n>4)-11).... blah blah ... we don't know anything, science can't inform us, so we might as well ignore it.\n\nIt gets old when non-scientists say that miraculous new technologies of the future will undo our damaging and unsustainable practices of the present.  The scientists, the people who help invent such technologies, are the very people who are saying that there's a real problem.  There are limits on what technology can do.  Energy must be conserved, the laws of thermodynamics must be obeyed, etc., etc.. Scientific progress isn't a a source of miracles that will inevitably swoop in and save us at the last minute, like some labcoat-wearing dues ex machina.",

I've got nothing else to do with them:\n\n>The Antarctic temperature was warmer,and atmospheric CO2 and CH4 concentrations were higher, during interglacials 5.5 and 9.3 than during the Holocene and interglacial 7.5. The temporal evolution and duration of stages 5.5 and 9.3 are indeed remarkably similar for all properties recorded in Vostok ice and entrapped gases. As judged from the Vostok record,the long, stable Holocene is a unique feature of climate during the past 420kyr,with possibly profound implications for evolution and the development of civilizations. Finally, CO2 and CH4 concentrations are strongly correlated with Antarctic temperatures;this is because, overall, our results support the idea that greenhouse gases have contributed significantly to the glacial‚Äìinterglacial change. This correlation, together with the uniquely elevated concentrations of these gases today, is of relevance with respect to the continuing debate on the future of Earth‚Äôs climate.\n\nClimate and atmospheric history of the past 420,000 years from the Vostok ice core, Antarctica J.R.Petit, J.Jouzel, D.Raynaud, N.I.Barkov, J.-M.Barnola, I.Basile, M.Bender, J.Chappellaz, M.Davisk, G.Delaygue, M.Delmotte, V.M.Kotlyakov, M.Legrand, V.Y.Lipenkov, C.Lorius, L.Pepin, C.Ritz, E.Saltzmank & M.Stievenard\n\n>There is good evidence that higher global temperatures will promote a rise of greenhouse gas levels, implying a positive feedback which will increase the effect of anthropogenic emissions on global temperatures. However, the magnitude of this effect predicted by the available models remains highly uncertain, due to the accumulation of uncertainties in the processes thought to be involved. Here we present an alternative way of estimating the magnitude of the feedback effect based on reconstructed past changes. Linking this information with the mid-range Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimation of the greenhouse gas effect on temperature we suggest that the feedback of global temperature on atmospheric CO2 will promote warming by an extra 15‚Äì78% on a century-scale. This estimate may be conservative as we did not account for synergistic effects of likely temperature moderated increase in other greenhouse gases. Our semi-empirical approach independently supports process based simulations suggesting that feedback may cause a considerable boost in warming.\n\nScheffer, M.,V. Brovkin, and P.Cox (2006), Positive feedback between global warming and atmospheric CO2 concentration inferred from past climate change, Geophys. Res.

(1997) that urban effects on 20th century globally and hemispherically averaged land air temperature time-series do not exceed about 0.05¬∞C over the period 1900 to 1990 (assumed here to represent one standard error in the assessed non-urban trends).\n\n>...\n\n>Clearly, the urban heat island effect is a real climate change in urban areas, but is not representative of larger areas. Extensive tests have shown that the urban heat island effects are no more than about 0.05¬∞C up to 1990 in the global temperature records used in this chapter to depict climate change. Thus we have assumed an uncertainty of zero in global land-surface air temperature in 1900 due to urbanisation, linearly increasing to 0.06¬∞C (two standard deviations 0.12¬∞C) in 2000.\n\nClimate Change 2001: Working Group I: The Scientific Basis, Chapter 2. Observed Climate Variability and Change, IPCC Third Assessment Report\n\n>Large-scale increases in the heat content of the world's oceans have been observed to occur over the last 45 years. The horizontal and temporal character of these changes has been closely replicated by the state-of-the-art Parallel Climate Model (PCM) forced by observed and estimated anthropogenic gases. Application of optimal detection methodology shows that the model-produced signals are indistinguishable from the observations at the 0.05 confidence level. Further, the chances of either the anthropogenic or observed signals being produced by the PCM as a result of natural, internal forcing alone are less than 5%. This suggests that the observed ocean heat-content changes are consistent with those expected from anthropogenic forcing, which broadens the basis for claims that an anthropogenic signal has been detected in the global climate system. Additionally, the requirement that modeled ocean heat uptakes match observations puts a strong, new constraint on anthropogenically forced climate models. It is unknown if the current generation of climate models, other than the PCM, meet this constraint.\n\nDetection of Anthropogenic Climate Change in the World's Oceans, Tim P. Barnett, David W.

We compiled the most recent observed climate trends for carbon dioxide concentration, global mean air temperature, and global sea level, and we compare these trends to previous model projections as summarized in the 200 I assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)\n\n>...\n\n>Since 1990 the observed sea level has been rising faster than the rise projected by models, as shown both by a reconstruction using primarily tide gauge data (2) and, since 1993, by satellite altimeter data (3) (both series are corrected for glacial isostatic adjustment). The satellite data show a linear trend of 3.3 ¬± 0.4 mm/year (1993-2006) and the tide gauge reconstruction trend is slightly less, whereas the IPCC projected a best-estimate rise of less than 2 mm/year.\n\n>...\n\n>Overall, these observational data underscore the concems about global climate change.

A great example i read detailed where a weather station was moved 40 miles after being in service for several decades.  When it moved the temperature characteristics of the area it moved to were different from where it had been and they discovered the calibration of the old thermometer had been off and the type of enclosure had changed to protect better from direct sunlight.  This required complex adjustments to the historical data to ensure a smooth transition with data from the new site.  A naive analysis of the data would show a sharp change when it was moved that is purely an artefact of the method of measurement, not a real change.  \n\nThis is just one weather station.  Imagine now that adjustments like this are required at every single station where data needs to be contiguous over a period of decades.  You really want the raw data?",

There is plenty of evidence that this is the case, that we can have an impact on our climate, and as such I do not see why this topic is somehow unique.\n\n>My own understanding of things allows me to believe in Evolution, and Relativity as a result of my own thoughts, and understanding of how things work. \n\n...\n\n>I believe in them through a trust that people have thought things through. \n\nYou implied that while you believe in evolution, you haven't examined all the evidence, it's merely that the process makes sense to you. Is this the case? If so, why does anthropogenic climate change not make sense to you, where are you getting hung up? Carbon Dioxide traps heat, we produce more CO2 than would be produced naturally, CO2 hangs out in the atmosphere, therefor there will be more radiation (heat) held in by said atmosphere. This trapped radiation increases temperature, and an increase in temperature beyond a certain point can cause a chain reaction (the \"tipping point\").\n\nI don't see why any of this is terribly different from the way any of these other things have worked. Maybe it's the idea of a tipping point that causes you pause, but that's simple too http://www.pbs.org/now/shows/527/oceans-climate-change.html (if you don't want to watch the whole thing skip to 3:30ish and once that's done skip to ~9:30).\n\nIt's also extremely surprising to me that one could believe in evolution and dismiss anthropogenic warming. The Earth has evolved as a whole to adapt to a certain balance, it is able to deal with a certain level of CO2, and the mechanisms it has in place are meant to deal with these levels. Now we have changed the environment by producing an abundance of CO2 beyond planetary norms. A system that developed gradually over a long period of time cannot somehow be unaffected by such a sudden change. In an animal population, a sudden change in food source can lead to extinction, or mass death as only the ones capable of processing this new food will live. Sure, the Earth will be around if this happens, and we may stick around after our environment suddenly shifts as well, but most of us will not.\n\nLastly, the thing in your OP which really stuck in my craw was this statement:\n\n>I keep reading about this subject to find that scientists are finding surprising new properties to things.\n\nThis is what science is! It's not just climate change, scientists are constantly discovering new things about everything! Science adapts (which is why it is different from religion), it incorporates new information and it improves its ideas and knowledge. The simple act of learning doesn't negate all prior knowledge, and it doesn't mean you will discover new information that will run contrary to our previous understandings. It may happen, sure, but it is unreasonable to ignore or minimize all scientific data because of the mere possibility it could change in the future (in part because you may need that data to discover the truth of the situation). Science is a constant process of refinement, of discovering the new and replacing the old; to try and minimize something because it may be negated is to abandon science altogether.",

      "text": "Two of the rational scientists who take the denial side are Lindzen and Akasofu.  I don't know of any others.  Lindzen is the only one who's *really* a climate scientist; Akasofu is a more general geophysicist who has dabbled in the subject in a legitimate way.  Akasofu and Lindzen are the sort of nagging contrarians who might serve some useful purpose in most fields: they're usually wrong, but they help keep others honest and rigorous.  Unfortunately in climate science that role is more destructive, because it provides false legitimacy to people who want to prevent urgently needed action for political reasons.\n\nYou can read what Lindzen and Akasofu write and typically find very good explanations of why they're wrong from other climate scientists.  Following both sides of the argument, I don't at all get the sense that these are two brilliant mavericks out there in front of the curve... they're not modern-day Einsteins or Galileos putting out a brilliant idea and waiting for everyone else to come around.  The climate scientists who take the time to refute them seem more logical and data-driven than even the most credible deniers.",

      "text": "I like the way you're so confident about the ONLY way to stop sea levels continuing to rise. Maybe you might like to reconsider that stance?\n\nMy response to you is not to deny the warming is happening, nor to debate the why of it either. That would be pointless - \"Internet Style\".\n\nPerhaps you might like to consider these facts and respond again:\n\n1) We are not a type 1 civilisation on the Kardashev scale. Look it up. It will likely be 100 years or more until we approach that point.\n\n2) We do not know what effect attempting to change our atmosphere will have. We *think* we know, but thinking doesn't cut it when consider spending 100 TRILLION dollars.\n\n3) To date, no model has successfully predicted existing conditions from ANY point in the past. How can you have any confidence in predicting climate effects when we start to twiddle?\n\n4) Of all global warming gasses, water vapour is the most dominant. Yet our models are incapable of modelling with sufficient granularity to handle this fact. I ask again - how can you have confidence in predictions made from models that do not work?\n\n5) The dollars we spend (Trillions of them) to directly reduce CO2 output are an unknown spending - we can't predict what will happen when we reduce our output - exactly. However, we known down the last cent the exact output of measures designed to alleviate the warming. These are known returns on investment. How can you justify spending trillions on one thing of unknown value when half that amount would more than offset the effects of the warming to a large degree?\n\n6) The energy generating business (since we invented fire) has been on a rapid downward spiral of C02 emitted per watt of energy generated. Not once has any technology been subsidised to move to a lower CO2 output, and yet the trend is universally down. No legislation has been required. It's just more efficient and makes more money. When Fusion power arrives (and it will, and soon) the output per watt will be unmeasurable, so, instead of spending trillions on prevention when the economics of it do not make sense, how about spending 1% of that on Fusion research and development? Then you simply don't have to worry at all. Ever.\n\n7) If you asked a Londoner of 1900 what the most pressing problems of London in the year 2000 would be, their answer would universally be: \"How will you source 20 million horses, and how will you get rid of that much shit every day?\" We can easily see the assumption is silly from 2010, because technology leaves old problems behind, and creates a set of whole new problems to deal with. For us to say Global Warming will be the most important issue in 2100 is extreme hubris, and flies in the face of reason. I would argue that the most pressing problem facing the world today is supplying fresh drinking water to every person alive, and that this is far more important than worrying about GW in any shape or form. What's your take on THAT? Because for a tiny (and I do mean tiny) fraction of the 100 trillion dollars would supply everlasting drinking water for all mankind.\n\n8) The Carbon trading system is a pure (but complicated) scam and is one of the largest crimes ever perpetuated in my view. How can the public have confidence in ANY scheme which involves hundreds of billions of dollars and is almost entirely corrupt?\n\n9) If you had the choice of providing clean drinking water to you and your family now and in the future, or spending that same money on trying to \"prevent\" (LOL) GW, what would YOU do?\n\n10) The climate of Earth has always been changing, and it will never stop changing. It will, over time, ALWAYS get hotter, until the sun bakes the rocks dry on the surface and finally engulfs the planet entirely as a red giant. In what way do you think a Type 0 civilisation can even hope to achieve anything so massive as to control the atmosphere, and hence the climate of an entire planet?\n\n11) Examining the dire consequences of ice ages - which can approach with incredible speed - and the relatively benign effects of rising temperatures - how can you even worry at all about warming? Man, an ice age would wipe the surface clean of us instantly in geological time - and in less than a lifetime, if it began again now. With this in mind, how can you defend wanting to take ANY action which would even slow down the warming? It is certainly true that the farming of the world will evolve dramatically as a result of climate change and warming, and for every acre which is devastated, another acre of productive land will arise somewhere else. This will tip the balance of earnings to the warming lands in northern and southern latitudes for sure, but we have the technology to continue farming by using water better, and controlling its use more effectively. Why should we do anything at all to prevent any of this? We are more than capable of adapting to the changes. Humans have demonstrated repeatedly that we are the most adaptable animal ever to arise on this planet, and we occupy every niche on the planet bar the floors of oceans. In what way do you feel that humans are incapable of adequately adapting to a changing world? Bearing in mind we have been doing it for better than 1.5 million years already.\n\n12) Like many problems facing humanity, you are looking at (potential) 22nd century problems with early 21st century technology and knowledge. You do not account for the fact that from 2000 to 2010 humans added as much knowledge to our total store as from 1900 to 2000. It will double again between 2010 and 2020. Then it will double again, shortly thereafter. The best example I can think of is the \"idiots\" who began sequencing the human genome. The equipment they used would not (and could not) have completed the task in 1000 years, but they continued, because they KNEW that technology would provide machines which would quickly finish what took so long to even start to make a dent in. As it turned out they finished long before even the optimists thought they possibly could. You must have faith in advances in human knowledge - and in technology you can't even imagine now. In 1900 the best minds in the world could not foresee lasers, radar, computers in your hand, and thousands of other technologies which transformed the planet completely in less than 100 years.\n\nThe changes in technology and science in the NEXT 100 years will be even more remarkable. \n\nMy personal feeling is that doing anything at all to prevent climate change is a complete and utter waste of time, as the planet does not have a \"tipping\" point. The world has not been \"iceball Earth\" in over 600 million years, and it was Co2 that saved the planet back then. Since that time, the ratio of gasses in our atmosphere has swung WILDLY, and yet the planet never died, and ice ages, while some have been extreme, have never spun the earth into a run-away ANYTHING. The feedback mechanisms of this planet are fierce and powerful - and we still do not understand them properly at all.\n\nBasically, I'm saying that we should spend money on things we KNOW the outcome of, and quit being so fucking terrified (which is what the powers want you to be. No fear = no control) of things that *might* happen. Humans are filled with hubris, and thinking we can control our planet's climate is the greatest and worst example ever of humanity's delusional behaviour.\n\nWe will get there one day, but that day is a while away yet.",

      "text": "Weather != Climate.  Both are complex, but when you talk about chaos and meteorologists, you're talking about weather.  While predicting whether it will rain ten days from now is fiendishly complex, predicting that it will be warm in Chicago in July is not. That's not to say we have perfect climate models -- we don't. But conflating short term specific predictions with finding long term trends is a favorite pastime of both the ignorant and those with an agenda on this issue.\n\nTo your second point, it's unfortunate, but we're in the middle of a highly complex scientific endeavor here, and you aren't going to find one guy somewhere who discovered and proved AGW and published his data in a 20 page journal article. It's a lot messier than that. There are hundreds of different research groups, each working in specific areas, and the whole picture, or at least what we have of it, arises only from the union of all of this work. The data is widely dispersed and often contradictory. However, that doesn't mean that the idea is wrong. It's the way science works. Multiple people work, get together, collaborate, figure out each other's problems, toss out mistaken ideas, back up three steps, etc. The lack of a single \"conclusive study\" isn't necessarily evidence of much of anything at this point.\n\nWhich brings me to the first point. What you're looking at is a short explanation intended for a popular lay audience. The very nature of the medium is that you aren't going to have a 500 entry bibliography referring to highly technical scientific papers. I'm sure that if you were to ask the folks at NASA or any other qualified research lab, they could point you to hundreds of peer reviewed journal articles to support dozens of claims made in the text. You just can't look at what is essentially a press release, and from the lack of citations, assume that the citations don't exist.\n\nNotice that at no point have I weighed in on your skepticism, which may well be a reasonable position, but the evidence you've cited isn't very compelling. I do disagree with your insinuation that both sides are equally full of it.  It's certainly complex, and there are reasons to be suspicious, but, to dramatically oversimplify things, 50 climatologists in favor and 50 cattle farmers opposed does not make a draw.  It's not actually that difficult to find \"everyday scientists\" who are willing to talk about their work. I worked with a whole group of them about eight years ago, and AGW was not a terribly controversial subject to them.  Sure, there are a tremendous number of holes, and the details aren't well understood, but much like evolution, there can be disagreement over the details without casting doubt on the overall theory, although AGW is certainly not as well founded as evolutionary theory at this point.",

I don't recall having a specific conversation with the folks I worked with on the subject, but my general impression was that they were fairly uniform in their acceptance of global warming.  Of course, that's one small data point.\n\nI wish my part were that interesting. We (I as a graduate student) basically worked on one very narrow problem -- inverting an atmospheric model. The idea being that the tops of the clouds are visible to an orbiting satellite, and we have models that can say, \"if you have X conditions at the surface, the tops of the clouds will look like Y\", and so the goal was to efficiently (in real-time) invert that model. That way, the satellite could do the appropriate calculations to go from observing the cloud tops to inferring the surface (and intermediate atmospheric layer) conditions without having to send down all of the hairy data being collected in real time.  For us, it was basically just an optimization problem. At one time I understood their model pretty well, but I can't claim to have really done much in the way of science on the project, and my own research ended up going a different direction.",

I don't know of any systemic studies, but I'd be interested to see a survey on just how many scientists actually are incentivised to come up with historic changes in science.  Plus, this assumes that religious organizations and theology are static and unchanging.  They aren't.  They change as part of a dynamic system.

The paper still made it through the peer review process to make it into Science, one of the most respected scientific journals. \n\nDoes that mean that we should stop believing that biochemistry is real? Of course not. Should peer review have caught the mistake before it was published? Maybe, but it probably isn't a realistic expectation that every mistake will be caught. It was found later, and the article is now no more. That's how science works. Some stuff slips through the cracks of peer review, no matter how good the system is set up to be.

It is so easy to hide anything behind \"analysis\" and expert/specialist interpretation.  Lack of understanding of your audience should not be an excuse for ambiguity or opaqueness in the study/data.\n\nBecause this is a political issue (unfortunately) and any \"science\" (whether done correctly or not) has the potential to impact everyone (all the non-experts who are the majority) if used in defense of or against global warming, it is very rational and reasonable to question everything and see exactly how they came to their conclusions.",

In which case, I would expect to see peer reviewed articles on the matter being published in respectable journals.  Instead, these supposedly eminent scientists seem to publish their work in newspapers, magazines, and appear for interviews on Fox News.\n\nNow, it's certainly a theory that there is a vast global conspiracy where tens of thousands of scientists who started out in their academic careers as devoted seekers of knowledge and truth were corrupted by the piles of \"green money\" and now seek to undermine and pervert the profession that they once loved by denying publication to work based solely on their personal prejudices and financial interests, but in this case I think we are dealing with more common vernacular interpretation of \"just a theory\".",

Back in the late 80s there was a guy, Dr. Lou Frank, who was quite a big shot space scientist with his own department and everything. Back then there was a satellite made for imaging the Earth's auroral zones, it was the first such satellite and the image sensors were pretty crude, something like 256x256, maybe.\n\nWhen the images came back, they were pretty spectacular, but they had some black spots on them now and then. Lou Frank saw these and became convinced that they were evidence of micro comets hitting the Earth's atmosphere and leaving big, temporary holes.\n\nHe developed a theory that all of Earth's water came from these micro comets, among other things, and he started getting grant money for researching this further. This pissed off my boss, Dr. Bill Hanson, because that could have been our money, and it was going towards funding what he considered a fruitless venture which had originated in the misunderstanding of the data.\n\nI was tasked with making some software to find and analyse the holes and graphically show the slope of the values going across them, while one of our team scientists was tasked with coming up with theories about how the data should look if it were real, as opposed to how it should look if it were merely data dropouts.\n\nThis whole debacle went on for at least a year, maybe two, and Frank was getting money for grad students and post docs getting more and more dug in to proving himself right, and the controversy raged in the journals and at the space sciences conferences.\n\nFinally, of course, it was proved wrong, and the whole story neatly proves your point: that sometimes scientists pursue ideas for the wrong reasons, until peer review comes to bite them in the ass.\n\nMeanwhile we're all still waiting for peer review to bite climate scientists in the ass. People are trying, as they should, but somehow they're unable to make anything stick.",

      "text": "Yah, that was pretty stupid. From what I understand though, such \"grey references\" (ie non-peer-reviewed) were only allowed in WG2 and WG3, not WG1 - only the latter of which dealt with the underlying physics. In addition, the worst conclusion - the one about glaciers, didn't make it into the synthesis report, the WG2 summary or even the exec summary for the chapter it was in (WG2 Ch 10; the faulty conclusion was in 10.6.2).\n\n**Update:** The WG1 can use grey references. From [this post at Realclimate](http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2010/02/ipcc-errors-facts-and-spin/) (well worth reading in full):\n\n> The IPCC cites 18,000 references in the AR4; the vast majority of these are peer-reviewed scientific journal papers. The IPCC maintains [a clear guideline](http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/press/ipcc-statement-principles-procedures-02-2010.pdf) on the responsible use of so-called ‚Äúgray‚Äù literature, which are typically reports by other organizations or governments. Especially for Working Groups 2 and 3 (but in some cases also for 1) it is indispensable to use gray sources, since many valuable data are published in them: reports by government statistics offices, the International Energy Agency, World Bank, UNEP and so on. This is particularly true when it comes to regional impacts in the least developed countries, where knowledgeable local experts exist who have little chance, or impetus, to publish in international science journals.\n\n> Reports by non-governmental organizations like the WWF can be used (as in the Himalaya glacier and Amazon forest cases) but any information from them needs to be carefully checked (this guideline was not followed in the former case). After all, the role of the IPCC is to assess information, not just compile anything it finds.  Assessment involves a level of critical judgment, double-checking, weighing supporting and conflicting pieces of evidence, and a critical appreciation of the methodology used to obtain the results. That is why leading researchers need to write the assessment reports ‚Äì rather than say, hiring graduate students to compile a comprehensive literature review.",

I don't recall having a specific conversation with the folks I worked with on the subject, but my general impression was that they were fairly uniform in their acceptance of global warming.  Of course, that's one small data point.\n\nI wish my part were that interesting. We (I as a graduate student) basically worked on one very narrow problem -- inverting an atmospheric model. The idea being that the tops of the clouds are visible to an orbiting satellite, and we have models that can say, \"if you have X conditions at the surface, the tops of the clouds will look like Y\", and so the goal was to efficiently (in real-time) invert that model. That way, the satellite could do the appropriate calculations to go from observing the cloud tops to inferring the surface (and intermediate atmospheric layer) conditions without having to send down all of the hairy data being collected in real time.  For us, it was basically just an optimization problem. At one time I understood their model pretty well, but I can't claim to have really done much in the way of science on the project, and my own research ended up going a different direction.",

So, who in religion is remembered?  Well, [This guy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther) is remembered, chiefly for overturning the status quo and making something new.   So, for that matter, are [this guy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad) and [this guy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ) and [this guy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautama_Buddha).    So, again it doesn't seem that different.  Another similarity common to both systems of organized philosophy, btw, is that most people in them don't actually go on to make history.  Most, indeed, seem to persue a career and protect their positions, while doing their small bit for their organizations along the way. \r\n\r\nAlso I'd point out again that if you look at the history of science, the incentives are actually about as negative for true original research that challenges existing dogma as in religion.  If you look at the originator of continental drift theory, for instance, [Wegener](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Wegener), he was treated rather badly during his lifetime by the scientific establishment.  Much progress in science depends, indeed, on waiting for scientists to die.  On Edit.  I don't know of any systemic studies, but I'd be interested to see a survey on just how many scientists actually are incentivised to come up with historic changes in science.  Plus, this assumes that religious organizations and theology are static and unchanging.  They aren't.  They change as part of a dynamic system.   But I don't have time to develop that argument fully so I'll just drop it.",

These induced geo-electric fields present a risk to the reliable\noperation of electric power systems and may affect gas and oil pipelines, railways, and other\ninfrastructures that have long conductive paths. For example, a geo-electric field induced by a spaceweather\nevent can produce electric currents (i.e., geomagnetically induced currents [GICs]) that could\naffect electric-grid system stability, with the potential to damage or cause the failure of essential electric\npower transmission components. Depending on the severity of the geomagnetic storm, cascading\nsystem failure or damage could lead to regional interruptions of electrical power distribution and result\nin complications with recovery and restoration efforts. To be useful, geo-electric field benchmarks\nshould characterize the induced geo-electric field at the Earth‚Äôs surface (E-field). This parameter can\nfeed directly into vulnerability studies conducted by industry and the private sector.\nAt a minimum, the E-field benchmarks and associated confidence levels will define the following:\n\n‚Ä¢ Amplitude of the induced E-field; and\n\n‚Ä¢ Time dependence of the induced E-field.\nAt a minimum, these benchmarks will be developed for the following event occurrence rate and\nintensity level:\n\n**‚Ä¢ An occurrence frequency of 1 in 100 years; and**\n\n‚Ä¢ An intensity level at the theoretical maximum for the event.\n\nAll benchmarks will state the assumptions made and the associated uncertainties and provide sufficient\nmeans to account for regional differences across the United States.\n\nThe following actions will be taken to develop induced geo-electric field benchmarks:\n\n1.1.1 The Department of the Interior (DOI), the Department of Commerce (DOC), and the National\nAeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), in coordination with the Department of\nHomeland Security (DHS), the Department of Energy (DOE), and the National Science\nFoundation (NSF), will:\n (1) assess the feasibility of establishing functional benchmarks using\ncurrently available storm data sets, existing models, and published literature; and\n (2) use the existing body of work to produce benchmarks for specific regions of the United States.\nDeliverable: Develop Phase 1 benchmarks\n\n**Timeline: Within 180 days of the publication of this Action Plan**\n\n1.1.2 DOI, DOC, NASA, and NSF, in coordination with DHS and DOE, will assess the suitability of\ncurrent data sets and methods to develop a more-refined (compared to Phase 1) set of\nbenchmarks.

Jaise aapka YouTube channel hai, toh aapko pata hoga ki online earning ko stable career kaise banaya jaye.<br><br>Meri health abhi thodi improve hui hai, par jab tak 100% theek na ho jaun, tab tak career aur future ke baare mein sochna galat hoga? Matlab pehle health theek kar loon ya phir parallel career bhi start kar sakta hoon?<br><br>Mujhe dar lagta hai ki agar main late ho gaya toh sab aage nikal jayenge. Agar 24-26 saal ki age me dobara study start karunga toh kab graduation complete hoga, kab kaam milega? Aajkal early 20s me log lakhon kama rahe hain. Village ke log bhi ghar baithe online paise kama rahe hain. Gaming, YouTube, online business, freelancing se log luxury life jee rahe hain.<br><br>Toh kya mujhe bhi online earning shuru karni chahiye?<br>Main ghar walo ko support karna chahta hoon aur unki takleef nahi badhani chahta. Lekin kya hum sirf online earning par depend ho sakte hain?<br><br>Mujhe dar lagta hai ki agar ek din meri online income source band ho gayi toh kya hoga?<br><br><br><br>Agar freelancing account suspend ho gaya?<br><br>Agar online store ya blog band ho gaya?<br><br>Agar account hack ho gaya?<br><br><br>Aise time par kya karein?<br>Kya sirf online earning par depend hona safe hai?<br>Ya phir offline small business bhi setup karna chahiye, taaki backup ho?<br><br><br>2nd Question - Konsa Skill Choose Karun?<br><br>Mujhe kuch career options me confusion hai, please help karein ek skill choose karne me. Mere paas normal laptop (i3, 8GB RAM, SSD) hai, toh heavy software wale kaam nahi kar sakta.<br><br>Mere paas ye options hain:<br><br>1. Web,app Development (Freelancing)<br><br>2. Video Editing<br><br>3. Designer - Graphic Design vs UI/UX how to choose and which is better?<br><br>1. Web,app Development (Coding, Freelancing):<br><br>Freelancing ek stable career ban sakta hai?<br><br>Agar account suspend ya delete ho gaya toh kya hoga?<br><br>Freelancing ko business me kaise convert karein, taaki lifetime kaam mile?<br><br>Agar hum bimaar pad gaye ya break liya toh clients doosre freelancers ke paas chale jayenge, tab kya karein?<br><br><br>2) Designer - Graphic Design or UI/ux  Designer: <br><br>AI bhi design bana raha hai, toh future me is field ka kya hoga?<br><br>Bina degree ke UI/UX ya Graphic Designer ban sakta hoon?<br><br>Agar job ke liye degree zaroori hai, toh freelancing option kaisa rahega?<br><br>Freelancing me Graphic Designing ke kaam ka competition bahut hai, oversaturated h kya gd ui ux design se? Ui ux design better h kya wo learn krna better rahega kya graphics designer se? Dono me confused hu ki konsa choose kru? Canva designers ki wajah se gd saturation bdh gya h kya? Q ki aajkal canva designers bhi khud ko graphics designer bol rhe h jab ki jinko gd colour theory, typography, design and softwares sab pata hai wo real graphic design h. Canva designers bs bne bne template edit krke dete hai.  So please tell kya ye freelancing future-proof career hai?<br><br>Kya specific niche designer banna thik hai ya overall Graphic/UI/UX Designer banna better hai?<br><br><br>4) Video Editing:<br><br>Kya video editing ek stable career hai?<br><br>Mere laptop (i3, 8GB RAM) me video editing possible hai ya high-end laptop chahiye? Q ki uske high end and heavy softwares h like davinsi and adobe premiere pro etc <br><br>MacBook ya 50k-70k ka high-end PC zaroori hai kya?<br><br>Agar sirf Shorts ya Instagram ke liye video editing karun toh kya acha hoga? Q ki usme heavy and high end softwares ki need nhi lagegi i guess. Please tell.<br><br>Ek achha video editor kaise banein? What is the principal and basis of video editor?<br><br><br><br><br>And kuch or bhi coding related career options h usme bhi career bnaya ja sakta h kya as a Dropout?<br>üëáüèª<br>+ There are some career options in coding qualifications, degree , formal education matters in this career options?

It&#39;s like first I learned Python, Pandas, NumPy and everything in the order you mentioned. I am a fast learner, so it happened quickly for me. Now I am studying ML from a book with a lizard cover (I forgot the name but the author was something like &#39;O really&#39;). After I get the Basics of ML, I will pursue a course that gives me the DS certificate, I am in a good college (prestigious) now. But previously, I wasted my one year in a quick sand of a college. At that time I pursued DS because I was so stuck in that college, it was haunting me (politics, hierarchy and all).<br>So about the thing, I am thinking about doing DS twice, firstly an overview(to see &#39;kitne pani me hun mai&#39;) and after that I will deep dive.",

Well Software Engineering is not web development we have all different sorts of fields, like if we made it through an industry as difficult as this what? you think I can&#39;t learn AI Engineering? You think we can&#39;t learn data Analytics? And there&#39;s the issue of the world moving with the technology(technologia). By the time AI is that dominant, the roles would just require different things  it may not be just DSA, but also Machine Learning Deep Learning experience. <br>You think the people who have gone through the grind, learnt the stuff built projects, sloved problems, got hired in this market are those that are cooked? <br>In reality it&#39;s just another problem to be solved.

Both individuals remain in isolation at this time. Despite these cases in Florida, the overall immediate threat to the public remains low.\n\nGovernor Ron DeSantis said, ‚ÄúI have been working with federal partners and our Department of Health to ensure that communities are ready to handle the challenges presented by COVID-19. The dedicated professionals at our county health departments, as well as those working at local medical providers, are well equipped to address these and future cases. State Surgeon General Dr. Scott Rivkees has taken appropriate, decisive action to help affect the best possible outcomes, and I will continue directing our state agencies to do whatever is necessary to prioritize the health and well-being of Florida residents.‚Äù\n\nLieutenant Governor Jeanette Nu√±ez said, ‚ÄúFlorida is a national leader in public health, and that quickly became evident as soon as we received information regarding presumptive positive cases of COVID-19 in our state. Public health teams from our Department of Health have already begun engaging with the impacted individuals and are quickly working towards identifying and contacting everyone who may be potentially affected by this virus. Thanks to the extensive preparations and tireless work the Department‚Äôs staff has been undertaking since information regarding COVID-19 became available in early January, our county health departments, medical providers and all other partners in public health are well prepared to prevent the spread of COVID-19.‚Äù\n\nState Surgeon General Dr. Scott Rivkees said, ‚ÄúThis is the scenario that we prepare for every day in public health. The Department is moving forward with the appropriate plans, and we are working directly with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and local medical providers to ensure these individuals receive the proper treatment and that anyone who has come into contact with them is following the necessary protocols, limiting or stopping any further spread. Thanks to Florida‚Äôs integrated public health system, we have been able to proactively engage and plan with our public health partners at every level, enabling us to take these important steps in a very expeditious manner. Our epidemiological teams are among the best in the nation, and they are right now aggressively pursuing every potential lead during these critical early moments of this outbreak in Florida.‚Äù\n\nThe first patient is an adult Manatee county resident without travel history to countries identified for restricted travel by the CDC. This person did seek health care, is isolated and will continue to remain isolated until cleared by public health officials. The Florida Department of Health is working closely with the patient, their close contacts and health care providers to isolate and monitor persons who may have been exposed to COVID-19 and implement testing of anyone who may develop COVID-19 symptoms, including fever, cough, or shortness of breath.\n\nThe second patient is an adult resident of Hillsborough county with a history of travel to Italy. This person is isolated and will continue to remain isolated until cleared by public health officials.\n\nCOVID-19 can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth, including when an individual coughs or sneezes. These droplets may land on objects and surfaces. Other people may contract COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.\n\nSymptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough and shortness of breath. Symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days following exposure. Most people recover from the COVID-19 without needing special treatment. The elderly and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems and diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness.\n\nThere is currently no vaccine to prevent COVID-19. The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus. As a reminder, the Department always recommends everyday preventive actions to help impede the spread of respiratory diseases, including:\n\nAvoiding close contact with people who are sick;\nStaying home when you are sick and avoiding contact with persons in poor health;\nAvoiding touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands;\nCovering your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then disposing of the tissue;\nWashing your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom, before eating, after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing;\nIf soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty; and\nCleaning and disinfecting frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.\nThe CDC does not recommend that asymptomatic, healthy people wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19. Facemasks should be used by people who show symptoms of COVID-19 to help prevent the spread of the disease to others. The use of facemasks is also crucial for health workers and people who are taking care of someone in close settings (at home or in a health care facility).\n\nA person that experiences a fever and symptoms of respiratory illness, such as fever, cough or shortness of breath, within 14 days after travel from China, Italy, Iran, South Korea, Japan and any other destination under CDC travel advisory should call ahead to their health care provider and local county health department (CHD) and mention their recent travel or close contact.\n\nIf a person has had close contact with someone showing these symptoms who has recently traveled from this area or been in contact with a person with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, they should call ahead to a health care professional and the county health department. The health care professional will work with the Department to determine if the person should be tested for COVID-19.\n\nPlease visit the Department‚Äôs dedicated COVID-19 webpage at www.FloridaHealth.gov/COVID-19. This remains the best and most up-to-date resource for information and guidance regarding COVID-19 in Florida.",

      "text": "/u/Zementid, while our team does not decide, nor work on, Office products, you do ask a very good question.\n\nAn answer I was given some time ago from a usability team was that they bring in people who use the existing products on a regular basis and ask them what they like and don't like about the current version(s).

      "text": "Really well thought out post.\n\nI love how you took time to read responses and answer *(or question their responses.)\n\n*i wish more reddit posts were as well done as this one.\n\n- as for my opinion, i think 5g is just more of a money grab, but for what benefit?\n\n\n- If i was fairly happy with my 4g service can i continue to use 4g at today's prices and not move to 5g for the higher price? Maybe i can in 2020 or 2021. But as we saw with 4g LTE if every website increases the data being streamed and played in the background of their site just because this new technology exists.....within a few years you will be forced to switch over to 5g or your service will be ridiculiously slow cause of all the \"upgrades\" the sites you are trying to view has made.\n\n- i loved the user who compared 5g to \"we have been using radio waves *(in a totally different spectrum) for 100 years!\"\n\nThat's like saying - well obviously radiation cannot hurt us, cause you go out in the sun all the time and that doesnt hurt you and the sun radiates energy *(to which i reply if you stay out with no sunblock lotion, you will get a terrible tan/sunburn)\n\nBut more specifically to this point that light waves are at a frequency that is pretty well blocked by the skin, and our human bodies dna have evolved for over 2 million years *(maybe 3 million) to develop just the right level of protection in skin to reduce the suns damage, through hundreds of thousands of generations \n\nRF radiation has only been around \"100 years\" or so and cell phones 25 years or so.... even today there's no way to quantify the people living today are equally as healthy as the ones living 101 years ago because there are so many other outside influences that impact that equation.\n\nBut if you look at other things that generate RF energy in similar spectrums *(radars) they usually have radhaz limits. *(don't stand within 500 ft when this is energized or some variation of distance and parameters etc.\n\nI wish that websites would be required to continue to allow you to download from the \"low bandwidth version\" of their site we used 7+ years ago. I hate where the internet has evolded to now that you must have wifi or  4g LTE (or better) or you just cannot enjoy viewing internet from your phone.\n\n- i think that the changes to net neutrality in the past few years are going to completely change the way we use internet over the next 15 years. We will regret ever allowing that to pass with out rioting in the streets. 5g will (likely) utilize those changes against the consumer and small business until the only thing you can get to is the biggest chains paying ISPs the highest margin. *(like the opposite of clickbait) - if you click to search for a product instead of an algorithm feeding you products its thinks you are likely to buy, instesd it will feed you products sold by the companies who provide a profit margin towards that ISP.\n\nThis last paragraph might be slightly unrelated to your original post. But i think it is a factor (like a second or third order effect in the cause and effect tree now, but will be the root of alot of hatred ten years from now.)\n\nWhy do i mention net neutrality or the lack thereof with regards to 5g? If this service is as great as it could be someday - it should completely remove the need for families/companies to need an ISP like cox or at+t or road runner, etc to provide their home wifi connection. And once that happens - those same isp's still need their profits to stay viable and they will get those on the other end......as kick backs from the companies who get the highest bandwidth for sales and clicks \n\nIt is directly related but it is a factor no one wants to correlate.\n\nSorry if i rambled on and hope my incoherent babbling turned into some ideas that make sense.\n\nThey are just my theories and you know what they say about usernames checking out.",

      "text": "Yes and no.  Very few retailers are going to turn off magstripe right away, too many people will not have EMV cards.  I would be surprised at the 50% adoption rate.  I might be able to see 50% of the total terminals support EMV, where you have a good portion of the major retailers upgraded, but 50% adoption based on the count of retailers I cannot see.  My company isn't even bothering.  The cost, if you don't already have terminals that support EMV, outweighs the risk for most.\n\nWhat and how is a whole other discussion.  First, it depends on the hardware.  Many card reader have a slot for EMV, and a slot for magstripe (in fact, most are this way, at least where I have seen them.)  For those readers, nothing stops you from using magstripe, because the reader doesnt know that the card also has emv.  Unless the banks are going to move to a fresh set of BIN codes (the portion of the card number that identifies who the issuing bank is), and reject magstripe when the auth is sent to the bank, I don't see how they will prevent you from using it.  Even if that was the case, that means additional software coding that is required for each retailer's POS software.\n\nAs far as what to do if they do have a chip card, and how to process, that is all left up to the retailer.  The retailer has the option if the chip is broken to fail back to magstipe, or to refuse to, but that is the retailer's choice, and is written into their specific code for each swipe device.  Most retailers that I have talked to have no plans to turn on \"refuse mag\" on EMV fail.  There is a whole workflow around EMV, and those options are left to the retailer (other options like how to handle EMV+Pin/sig when a device doesnt have a sigpad or keypad like a self service kiosk.)\n\nThe dreams that have been touted as EMV being the silver bullet for fraud is just a joke.  It is only trivially harder to clone an emv card, because all you need is the magstripe data and a card with a broken chip.  Not to mention there are WAY better solutions to prevent most card present fraud, and post transaction breaches.)\n\nBack to the Plastic implementation, all you would need is to support cloning the magstripe if Plastic hasnt added the bank for EMV yet, and have the Plastic device \"turn off\" the EMV chip for those transactions, so that the card reader at the retailer never knows the card was issued with EMV.  Again, short of additional checks put in place for the retailer to check if a transaction should have supported EMV, nothing else will fail.  Now, if banks are going to refuse magstripe transactions unless you call in and tell them your chip broke, and they allow magstripe until a new card is issued, then I dont see where the issue would be.  And I just dont see that happening anytime soon.  The whole reason that EMV is being implemented with signature instead of the FAR more secure PIN, is that banks / issuers were afraid people would not use their cards and use a card that doesnt require PIN.  You have to remember that every transaction makes the issuer money, and they dont want to do ANYTHING that could cause them to lose transactions, even in the name of saving fraud.",

I don't buy that places are still going to allow swipe when there's a chip unless the chip itself is broken, simply because that opens them up to the liability they were hoping to avoid.\n\nAlso, at least around here, a ton of major retailers have the new touchscreen Verifone or Ingenico terminals. They are probably waiting until October to turn EMV on, because otherwise why else would they upgrade? If it was solely to turn on Apple Pay/NFC there are cheaper options that they could have done instead. Hell, Best Buy for example already had NFC capable readers that they could have simply turned back on but instead installed new Ingenico ones.\n\nWhile it's likely the case that smaller places will take a lot longer, most people probably use their cards more often at larger retailers so chip will possibly end up being used often almost right away.\n\n* * *\n\nBack to Plastc. While they could change the service code so that chip isn't mandated any more, stores do send the full track data to issuers when running transactions.

At a minimum, you also have the development costs for your POS software, as most, out of the box, are not setup for EMV, and each POS software is generally further customized by an integration partner, which includes turning EMV on, its not just a switch you flip.  On the other side of that is companies that are abandoning the traditional POS system for card transactions, and the reader itself holds the POS application for cards and then sends the completed transaction data to the register's POS application.  Verifone offers this as their Point product (I believe Target may have goine to Point), and this incurs the integration costs already mentioned, but also incurs additional costs per year from Verifone for the solution, and EMV is an additional cost.  In most cases, there is also a licensing cost to Verifone / Ingenico terminals to enable EMV as well.  So retailers are running those numbers, looking at the costs, and comparing them to their card present fraud numbers - if your fraud is less than the yearly cost for EMV, why bother?  (This is exactly the position we found ourselves in, and we have opted to only roll out EMV for new stores.)\n\nThe issue on allowing mag transactions when there is a chip, again, comes down to hardware.  A lot of readers dont use the same slot for both, thus, unless there are additional measures put in place, the reader would have no way to know that the card swiped for mag, even had a chip.  Certainly this can be prevented with some additional steps during authorization when the bank responds back with a denial because chip wasn't used.  I have not yet seen this type of implementation, but granted, I only know what our bank is doing, and those that I have talked to in the industry.  That also goes back to why couldnt Plastic just disable the chip when you select to use a card you have added for mag where the bank didnt support the chip with Plastic, or even emulate a broken chip.  The only real issue I see here, is that /could/ leave Plastic open to liability issues later, but I would think the number of fraudulent transactions using a Plastic device would be quite low, unless criminals started using it as a way around EMV.\n\nAt the end of the day, I am not sure what Plastic is really capable of, and any solution to deal with EMV short of acceptance from the issuing bank, could be a crap shoot.  But like I said previously, retailers and banks are not in the business of refusing transactions, because they lose money.  And during the transition to EMV, there will be a lot of gaps, because you are going to HAVE to allow mag transactions because of the slow adoption rate.\n\nEMV just annoys the shit out of me.  Its NOT the answer people think it is.  You can reduce almost all card present breaches with end to end encryption to protect the card data from reader to bank, and use tokenization as the response from the bank, so that the retailer never sees or stores a card number.  This would have prevented Target, Home Depot, Sally Beauty, etc, because the malware would have never seen a card number.  EMV is really a solution for authentication, not a solution for protecting card data.",

Recently, I went on there and my wall was INCREDIBLY outdated. Back in the day, I was all about bodybuilding and cars, and then I switched to engineering and programming. So my point here is, lol jokes on them. They didn't seem to get **one** new piece of information about me since I left. My wall was still all bodybuilding stuff and cars which I haven't spent a minute looking at since, so in my opinion, they clearly had no idea about me 'currently'. I've been programming for years, so in my professional opinion, it's clear to me they had no way to track me via my throwaway email (especially using data fed to them by Google, which does use my real email).\n\nI got banned for posting a photo of Sarah Jessica Parker as a horse. I used to be very salty towards them for banning my email because they don't permaban people like that anymore. Now I am grateful because I seem to have sidestepped years worth of profiling.",

From what I understand, your advocating for technology as a means to digitally enhance our own intelligence and that the meta data is a digital reflection of our selves, since our information and actions define us, and that is precisely the information that we post or is being collected on us. But don't you fear the ability of that data to be exploited? Marketing for example, is designed not to just simply inform you of what products are available but convince you which ones you should buy. Google uses meta data to fine tune their marketing so that you only see adds for things you might want to buy. Couldn't this same meta data be used to make an idea of your political views and then filter your online search results? Information manipulation for the purpose of controlling popular ideas.",

      "text": "Sorry you had to talk with such a shit head of an employee, and I genuinely love the company I work for, so let me first clear up some things so you can understand what happened. First and foremost, if the story your telling is true, then the rep(now manager) is completely at fault. If he left you with the impression that any data or text messaging was included, it completely violates our employee code of conduct, as full customer disclosure is preached to every new hire. As you found out, roaming data isn't apart of the canada plan, and even though the droid isn't a global phone, the majority of canada's network is CDMA, which the droid will work and roam off of. There is a roaming CDMA feature, which is $64.99 a month ($35 more than the normal unlimited) so it could be as simple as that was not added. It really all depends on the expectations that were set up in the beginning.  The worst part is that we are reluctant to credit global charges because of the way the agreements work. Verizon has already paid the money to whichever network he was using, and believe it or not, the markup on global roaming isn't that much. Unfortunately, being a lowly manager, I can only credit up to $250, so if you want to pm me his phone number, (I can send you my VZW email just to verify) I can take a better look, and escalate this up to my boss, or call customer service for you. I won't be going into work until about 12:30 today, so let me if you would like me to try and do anything.",

If you are unable to get Verizon to refund your money in full by trying Consumerist, etc., then file a small claims dispute against Verizon.  \r\n\r\nTo do this:\r\n\r\n*Step 1*: go to the store you bought the Verizon phone phone and ask to speak to the manager; ask him for his full name.  Make sure you get it correctly; this is the person who you are going to sue.  When leaving, get the street address (you can always look this up later).\r\n\r\n*Step 2*: Go to your local court house and ask for the forms to fill out for a small claims. \r\n\r\n*Step 3*: Go to the county recorder‚Äôs office (usually in the same complex as the court) and lookup the legal name of Verizon. (Can a fellow Redditor lookup the legal name of Verizon?)\r\n\r\n*Step 4*: In your complaint, sue for $700 bill + activation fee + phone cost + accessory costs + COURT COSTS.  List only your damages in your complaint, do not reason why because this could come back to bite you when in court if you present a different reason why in your verbal testimony versus your written testimony.\r\n\r\n*Step 5*: Go to the sheriff‚Äôs office/servicing station (usually in the same complex as the court) and pay the $40 bucks or so to have a sheriff serve your complaint to the Verizon manager you got in Step 1.\r\n\r\n*Step 6*: Make sure to ask for NIGHT COURT at a time convenient for you.  Companies usually have to pay people overtime to for night court so they‚Äôre more likely to settle.\r\n\r\n*Step 7*: Show up to court‚Ä¶.. This is your primary argument: \r\n\r\nYou paid for a plan to specifically cover use in Canada as evidenced by the amount you paid for the plan versus their US only plans.  You would have never **considered** the plan and would have looked to another carrier had you known Verizon did not cover data + phone.  The word considered is a legal term where they made you an offer, and you considered it, and accepted it.  What was understood versus written down on paper may have been two completely different things, but had they not buried this consideration in the legalese contract they gave you, you would have never accepted the plan.  \r\n\r\nVerizon would have to prove to the court they told you, made it clear, and despite this you purchased the plan.  I doubt they will be able to do that.\r\n\r\n**tl;dr: sue in small claims court**",

      "text": "I doubt that this will really get noticed, but a similar thing happened to me with Fido here in Canada, the problem has to do with the fact that data on phones in Canada is way too expensive I guess so they may not have made a deal with Verizon for data, who knows. \n\nEither way what happened to me was that I had an \"Unlimited Text + MSN\" option on my cell phone plan that I had been paying for for over a year even though I never had a phone with MSN, one day my brother gave me his Moto Q which had MSN on it, so before I put in my sim I called up fido to make sure that I would be allowed to use MSN on this phone (Gave them the model and IMEI number etc) without getting charged anything, and they told me several times that it would not be a problem and that it was included in my plan (even put me on hold to confirm with their manager)\n\nNext bill comes around and it is for 850$ I nearly shit my pants, so I call them up and they tell me that it is because I used data on my phone and that there was nothing they could do to remove the charge. I protest telling them that I never used data on my phone and that there was no way I would pay 850$ for I believe it was 12 Megs of data. The people I spoke with all told me the same thing \"it was done on your phone so you are responsible for it\" They tried to convince me that I must have left my phone un-attended and that someone else used it to download content, again I argued that this wasn't possible as I always have my phone with me, and there is a keypad lock on it that was activated after 15 seconds of no buttons being pressed, on top of that it was in small increments of kbs at a time, so it was even more unlikely that someone was stealing it on a daily basis just to download a jpeg)\n\nFinally they put me through to the technical department who agreed with me that the data used by MSN on this phone (over 3G vs the old one which used SMS I believe) was what caused the data charges, and after threatening to leave after I explained that I confirmed that this phone was OK to use with my Text+MSN package **(and the point of this story is here OP read this)**they finally agreed to waive my fees but told me that they could NEVER do it again as long as I was a fido customer, this was the most important part of my call, because I then told them that that was unacceptable because I had already used my phone for 2 weeks in the new billing cycle and would not be willing to pay for that data either. After a bit more arguing they agreed to put a note on my file.\n\nA few weeks later I got my next bill which was another almost 900$ in extra data which they got rid of as soon as I called and summarized the situation for them.\n\nI cant offer much help for the end game, but it is possible for it to be waived. And once it is waived wait a month without data charges and then explain that he moved to canada and he wants out of the contract because they do not offer the service (data) in his new area or something.",

If I ever give a $ to a customer thats wrong I have to honor it and then generally get reamed by my boss. Thirdly, there is a global department and a normal department technically even though canada uses the same technology as us CDMA, its still considered global. So the next goal is to call customer support. At this point no one in the store can do anything for you. You have to go higher global support, then customer support by phone. Next you tell them you are going leave. In a way almost get violent but be very upfront. What they did was dishonest and the only way you fuckheads are making money are by lying to people and selling dishonest over priced data plans.

      "text": "I was also screwed over by a Verizon salesman. My wife, her sister, and I were all living together, and the place we had moved to had no reception for T-Mobile, so we were looking to get a new phone plan. We go to a Verizon kiosk in a mall, and the salesman helps us out and gives us instructions of how to get out of a cancellation fee with T-Mobile, which worked. Everyone seems to have a smartphone these days, and my wife had had one with T-Mobile, so we decided to get one. All three of us wanted a smartphone. Two Androids and a Blackberry. The guy tells us that he can give us a 30 day, risk-free trial where all we had to pay for was the services we used (the minutes, data, texting) and the phones if they aren't in good condition if/when returned. So we were like, sure, we will try it out. When we get home, we find out that we have little to no service there. We also come to a realization that three smartphones don't fit into our budget. We returned the phones in a week. We didn't have to pay a restocking fee or anything like that. We were refunded the cost of the phones at the kiosk.\n\n Six weeks later we get a bill from Verizon for $1,500. We call them up like WTF, this isn't right. They were charging us for deactivation fees, taxes, and activation fees. After we complained, they took everything off but they refused to void the $500 worth of activation fees, saying that they couldn't do it, and that the salesman himself said that he never promised us that we didn't have to pay activation fees. Why the hell would we agree to a 30 day trial if we had to pay for activation fees? For that matter, how much does it really cost to \"activate\" a cell phone?",

      "text": "Back in college I used to work in a call center explaining cell phone bills to people, so I'll be able to help you with this as long as you're willing to hear the good and bad news.  First the good (it was always better to tell people good news first when I worked the phones - they were less likely to start screaming):  The good news is that the roaming data cost Verizon a pittance, probably around $20-$30, so \"$700\" is a very imaginary number to them that they hope you'll pay.  You will call their call center and escalate and escalate (calmly ask to speak to the Supervisor, Director, Vice President, etc) and you will get it reduced or removed as long as you ask for a \"one time courtesy\" credit.  You misunderstood the contract, this is the first time it happened, and remember, it costs them a pittance to wipe the slate clean.  Don't settle for half, get them to remove 90%-100% of the roaming charges, and continue to escalate the call until you get what you want.  It may take an afternoon, it may take a half a week, but you'll get what you want as long as you stay on the phone.  Don't bother with email, and don't bother with anyone at the store level - they never have the authority.  When all else fails, a snail-mailed letter to the vice president of Verizon will usually get the job done.\n\nNow, the bad news - Verizon didn't screw you.  This post title is misleading.  I'm betting the conversation went a little something like \"Will this phone work in Canada?\"  \"yup - it's a US and Canada plan\"  Which is all very accurate - the phone service is unlimited in Canada and the US.  Data service (as you've learned) is different.  There's almost never an unlimited data roaming package - and if there is, I'm sure it costs a small fortune.  You are technically responsible for these charges because you didn't bother to learn the difference between data and voice, free vs. roaming.  However, Verizon didn't educate you well enough either, so you get to tug on their heart strings.  It's a really simple mistake on both ends, and there's no reason to post this shit all over the Internet because you have a victim complex.\n\nNow, the really bad news: Your brother will get another outrageous bill.  See, the bill was cut and mailed 7-10 days ago, so he's probably racked up another $250 in roaming charges since then - when you get that $700 credited, make sure you have them credit back next month's bill too.\n\nAnd finally, what to do next:  Close the account.  Sorry, Verizon uses very US-centric technology and isn't really great for using internationally - even Canada.  If your brother is spending most of his time in Canada, he should probably get a Canadian cell provider like Rogers.  If he goes with a 3G/GSM phone, he can just get in the habit of having a US provider and a Canadian provider, and swapping the SIMs at the border.  This is probably the most cost effective way to pull off splitting your year half in the US and half in Canada.\n\nBest of luck with the bill, don't give up, I promise you the squeaky wheel gets the oil.",

If you do, you will never see the money again. Get someone on the phone and get it straightened out.\n\nI will check with some friends at Verizon and see what that plan is actually supposed to cover, and whether or not a Droid is capable of data roaming in Canada. \n\nJust to double check: Which Droid does he have exactly? And what was the actual monthly cost of the plan (before taxes, the advertised price)?",

      "text": "This happens so much more often than anyone realizes. I managed an ISP call center for years, and many a time there would be a situation where a customer service rep would sell someone on a service / plan / whatever, telling the customer that it would do x in y scenarios. Forward to a month later, when they get their bill and are upset that their charges are through the roof. Adjusting for the few assholes who will say anything to get their bill reduced when it's clearly unjustified, there was no shortage of these issues that arose due to the rep they originally spoke with misinforming them. \n\nThis is what I suggested to every customer who asked to speak to the manager: when you call our call center looking to make changes to your service that will affect the way you are billed, begin the call by asking the customer service agent if they mind if you record the call. Many places will put you in a queue for an agent, but not before the automated message tells you \"this call may be recorded for <whatever> purposes\". This can work both ways, and can be incredibly useful when it comes to legally defending yourself against potentially disastrous billing issues. Most agents will not be adverse to this.\n\nYou will now have an *accessible* recording of your conversation and any subsequent agreements you're making in regards to account changes. If something happens down the road where you're billed in a way that contradicts the changes you've requested, you now have something to refer to when disputing your bill. \n\nNote that you'll want to record the part beforehand where you actually ask the agent if it's okay to record the conversation. This way, if the legality of recording the conversation ever comes into question, you have it on record that they OK'd it. If you record yourself asking them, and they say \"no\", stop recording and politely end the call and redial. With very little effort you'll soon be connected to someone who doesn't mind. \n\nThis isn't concrete protection, but in a situation where it's \"he-said / she-said\" , I've personally witnesed it come in incredible amounts of handy.",

Going this route avoids a lot of hassle trying to get the charges removed without strings attached. And, I don't see any reason we couldn't drop the data plan later (even next month). It's not like I'm going to sign some specially drafted contract agreeing to pay for this data plan for X months or something like that.\n\nIs the situation ideal? No. The best scenario was one where Verizon actually educated its employees so that they wouldn't sell plans they didn't understand. A better scenario was one where Verizon informed us once roaming data charges started to skyrocket. It would also have been better if Verizon's promotional material was clearer about what is and isn't covered; maybe if enough people like me have this problem and Verizon has to eat the bill (and if mrbangbang's to be believed, they're eating a significant real dollar amount) they'll rethink their sales literature.\n\nSo given where we ended up, I think it's an adequate compromise.",

If this information was not provided to you by either the sales person or in the original material you were given during the sale, but was only included in later documentation regarding the plan, you are in an excellent position to claim you were misled by the sales person.",

Changing the ideals of an entire group of people is a tough task. In the long run it took generations to rid the South and parts of the North of the plague of racism. We still see it today, but on the books were not racists anymore. \n\nWhat you have to decide is what the republicans went through during the Compromise of 1877, do they allow ex-confeds (traitors) rights to office and other perks geared towards them in order to get their man elected? Is it worth it in the end? Are you working towards a greater good? \n\nIf you really do want to form a stable relationship with your sister, a compromise of your integrity isn't as farfetched a bad idea as you think.

To my mind, \"immediate termination\" is something that can happen any moment for any reason and will usually be driven by how well you do your job, not your paperwork.  At worst, in more union-dominated states, wonky paperwork just provides an excuse for employers to do what they would have already done in a right-to-work state.  That is, I can't imagine wonky paperwork getting someone fired, when they were doing a good job to start with.  (So far, in my career, no one has ever accused me of doing a bad job, even when I might have in their shoes.)\n\nBut yes, mileage varies, not only from country to country but, within the US, from state to state.",

      "text": "so, heres what i got from my limited knowledge\n\nmy stance is\n\n1.  we have been putting out CO2 and other greenhouse gasses for only around 100 years, so, IMHO its pretty foolish to think wed have that much of an impact in the grand scheme of things (localized and regional temperature inversions trapping pollutants aside.) which by itself makes me for controlling emissions, but not sold on human caused climate change.\n\n2. volcanoes erupt all the time, which, you would think just one volcano eruption would vastly outweigh human CO2 output. and that one volcano in Hawaii has been erupting for decades. idk if that would be cancelled out by soot and ash emissions making a cooling effect, but it stands to reason that the CO2 from the volcano would stay in the atmosphere longer then the ash, negating the cooling effect.\n\n3. 10,000 years ago, the planet was in an ice age, arguably, we are STILL in an ice age as there are still continental ice sheets. now, looking at earths history, there have been alternating periods of ice ages and warm periods. this just might be a normal thing for earth to do, and we are blaming ourselves too much. not to say we should not be worried about losing low lieing areas, but it might be inevitable.\n\n4. http://www.livescience.com/1349-sun-blamed-warming-earth-worlds.html mars and about half of the other planets in the solar system are also warming. then again, half are experiencing no change, or cooling\n\n5. just because 90% of scientists say its us causing it doesn't make it us causing it. back in medieval times it was common consensus that the sun went around the earth. in order to further scientific advancement open minds are required, and open discussion, so, in my opinion, with the facts i have seen so far, i am not quite convinced that its man caused. and, if shown to be incorrect through a polite discourse, and i cant refute your claims, i will admit i am wrong. but as of yet, ive been getting your an idiot and no one willing to politely discuss with me the possibility climate change is not man made. and you shouldn't have to retaliate with rudeness if your right...right? makes you look like your defensive and subconsciously thinking your wrong.\n\n6.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Holocene_Temperature_Variations.png earth has been warming for the past few thousand years, and yes recent warming trends are rather steep, and it does correlate to human co2 emission rise, but correlation does not mean causation. Weather stations that are used to compute global temperature records are not evenly distributed over the planet. they are usually in cities and near blacktop/concrete/human structures. There were a small number of weather stations in the 1850s, and the number didn't reach the current 3000+ until the 1951 to 1990 period. it is feasible that this warming might actually be skewed by a increase in sensors and data points in recent times as opposed to historically. stations located in more populated areas could show warming due to increased heat generated by cities, rather than a global temperature rise.\n\n7. Although previous reports suggest slight recent continental warming, spatial analysis of Antarctic meteorological data demonstrates a net cooling on the Antarctic continent between 1966 and 2000, particularly during summer and autumn",

      "text": "Thanks for responding--I can definitely see where you're coming from, and I am more than happy to give you my take on it.\n\n> well, to me its obvious SOMETHING is happening\n\nLet's use this as our common starting point. We can both agree that something is clearly happening. A good place to start to see exactly *what* is happening is [NASA's Climate Change website] (http://climate.nasa.gov/key_indicators). We can measure things like the rise in sea level and the changing global temperature average. \n\nSo, we've got all that going for us. What causes it?\n\n> it seems..kinda foolish to assume that we can change such a big planet in such little time. no offence.\n\nNo offense taken at all--to be honest it does sound a little crazy. One thing to keep in mind though, is that humans never stop. This is from the same NASA website I linked to earlier: \"Over the last century the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil has increased the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). This happens because the coal or oil burning process combines carbon with oxygen in the air to make CO2. To a lesser extent, the clearing of land for agriculture, industry, and other human activities have increased concentrations of greenhouse gases.\" Almost as soon as we figured out that we could burn fossil fuels, humans went nuts. We also consumed just about every natural resource we could find. As our production methods became more efficient, our output of good things increased, but so did our output of harmful gasses and chemicals. Just look at the [situation] (http://www.weather.com/news/science/environment/shanghai-china-pollution-smog-hazardous-conditions-20131206) that China is in right now. All of that industrial progress comes at a cost, and they are certainly not an isolated example, nor are they the first industrial society to put production above environmental concerns. \n\n> naturally the planets gonna get warmer.\n\nThat's true. A planet's climate will naturally change over time. What is so disturbing, though, is the rate at which our own planet is changing. In 2010 the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences [stated] (http://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus) that 97% of climate scientists agree that that rate of increase is due to humans. This also means that we can be the solution--so don't think of it as a \"humans are bad and we all did something wrong.\" Think of it as \"we know that we've made mistakes, now let's all work as hard as we can to correct those problems.\" \n\n> maybe its a statistical anomaly because of the location of the sensors\n\nAt this point, climate scientists have studied just about everywhere. They have observed noticeable changes on land, at sea, and even from orbiting satellites. This means that we are most likely looking at exactly what that 97% of scientists agree on: statistically significant change caused by humans.\n\nI know that it's not all that comfortable to think that we, as humans, are harming the planet. It's not the end of the discussion, though. Ultimately we, as humans, can make a positive change too. At least we agree that something is happening, and that is the first step. Take a look at the NASA page I linked to and see what you think. I think it's pretty compelling.",

The very same things (trees) that, for hundred of years, fueled human progress also helped filter our air. So, if we're consuming all of these natural filters and not replacing them, there will most certainly be problems down the line.\n\n> but...why would it have such an impact at only 300 or so parts per million? thats TINY.\n\nYou're right--it definitely seems tiny. Again though, we have to think about it in context. Since 1750 (around the time that factories started to appear during the Industrial Revolution), there has been a [40% increase] (http://cdiac.ornl.gov/pns/current_ghg.html) in CO2 in the atmosphere. So, although the number seems insignificant, the *increase* is huge. That big of a jump in such a relatively short time--remember, 250 years is not a long time at all when we are thinking about the history of the world--is definitely not healthy or natural. Imagine that you woke up one morning and gained twenty pounds overnight. It would put tremendous strain on your body! Well, that's kind of what these gases are doing; they are appearing way too quickly to be ignored.\n\n> is CO2 the only greenhouse gas?\n\n[Nope!] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas) There are actually a number of gasses that contribute to the greenhouse effect. CO2 is the one that is usually mentioned the most.\n\n> aren't the majority of weather readings, and thus the majority of sensor data, taken from metropolitan areas?\n\nWell, temperature readings are only one part of the data that points to human involvement in climate change. We can measure the sea levels, shrinking ice caps, temperature change in the oceans, etc. All of these would be unaffected by metropolitan areas. Also, the data collected on the ground is backed up by data collected by satellites. This would indicate that those metropolitan sensors are telling the truth.\n\nDon't worry about the grammar--everything's come across smoothly so far! Don't be afraid to ask questions, even if you're unsure of the best way to do it. With practice, you'll probably get more comfortable with your own thoughts and expose yourself to a ton of new ways of thinking.",

The very same things (trees) that, for hundred of years, fueled human progress also helped filter our air. So, if we're consuming all of these natural filters and not replacing them, there will most certainly be problems down the line.\n\n> but...why would it have such an impact at only 300 or so parts per million? thats TINY.\n\nYou're right--it definitely seems tiny. Again though, we have to think about it in context. Since 1750 (around the time that factories started to appear during the Industrial Revolution), there has been a [40% increase] (http://cdiac.ornl.gov/pns/current_ghg.html) in CO2 in the atmosphere. So, although the number seems insignificant, the *increase* is huge.

I am genuinely interested to see what are the most likely causes of this diversity issue, between whites and other races, and between men and women (the ratio of girls to boys in my lectures as a physics student is easily 80/20). \n\nThe part that intrigues me the most is, how much evidence is there for the existence of systemic racism towards these groups purely based on their gender/ethnicity? What is the evidence against such claims? How have these studies controlled for all the other variables, such as income, quality of education pre-university, etc? What studies have been conducted that prove that this disparity is due to bias, instead of biological/cultural tendencies of these groups to not enter STEM? What studies have been done to disprove said hypothesis?\n\nKind regards,\n\nA Mexican Physics student in the UK :)",

Summary: changing ONLY THE NAME on a CV to manipulate race and gender, the authors asked physics and biology professors at U.S. research institutions to score prospective postdoc candidates on competence, hireability, and likeability. Statistically significant disparities were found between some of the different racial and gender groups even though the CVs are otherwise identical. This offers evidence that this bias exists and could be keeping qualified minorities from advancing in their careers.\n\nThe questions you ask are important but so, so hard to answer with the definitiveness that you are looking for. Consider: what reasonable (and ethical) experiment could be performed to demonstrate causation (vs correlation)? You ask for evidence of systemic racism that controls for income, early education, etc.---but those are factors that are also embroiled with systemic racism. People and society are so incredibly complex. From my observation in reading the rest of this thread: we are all thirsty for the answers to \"why is this happening\" and \"how can we help.\" From the experts' responses, there is clearly no one universally true answer or panacea. We cannot wait for the Nature article that tells us that racism happens exactly because of X, Y, and Z before we start to listen to and validate Black and minority voices when they tell us that they feel uncomfortable or pushed out of academic spaces.

There are multiple issues to unpack in this question‚Äîand each issue is obviously multifaceted, so I cannot fully answer your question (and as the replies indicate). To your first point:  Yes, we all agree there is a ‚Äúdiversity problem‚Äù and many [folx](https://forfolxsake.com/what-does-the-term-folx-mean/) are interested in understanding why this problem persists and is pervasive in the US and globally. In the STEM fields and education, we use terms like [leaky or blocked STEM pipeline](https://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2018/02/02/581849526/leaky-pipelines-plug-the-holes-or-change-the-system), [broadening participation efforts](https://www.nsf.gov/od/broadeningparticipation/bp.jsp), or [diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts](https://www.aaas.org/programs/diversity-equity-and-inclusion-programs) to describe, study, and explain this so-called diversity problem. [Like some others in the field](https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2019/10/02/negative-consequences-pipeline-metaphor-stem-fields-opinion), I find the [pipeline metaphor problematic](https://slate.com/technology/2017/10/the-problem-with-the-pipeline-metaphor-in-stem-education.html). Nonetheless, it‚Äôs an issue scholars in the US, along with countries in Europe [(like The Netherlands](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/09500693.2018.1540897?needAccess=true)), Africa ([like Kenya](https://theconversation.com/why-fewer-kenyan-women-are-choosing-or-completing-stem-courses-91706)), and elsewhere study and say begins early in life‚Äîsome say [even before elementary school](https://hechingerreport.org/the-stem-pipelines-giant-hole-starts-before-kindergarten/).\n\nThe diversity problem is deeply rooted in [white supremacy](http://www.sceneonradio.org/tag/season-2/), [racist](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Stamped_from_the_Beginning/e_3cCgAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&printsec=frontcover) and sexist ideologies, and biases. To better understand these ideas and the myriad ways they affect our lives, with hopes of engaging anti-racist work, I‚Äôve curated [this list of resources](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1msBqreACDpFVynqA54L408tKyOepT-pXhdaL8bTtVNc/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nSystemic racism exists in our world, especially in STEM based on race ([not a biological construct](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/05/what-we-mean-when-we-say-race-is-a-social-construct/275872/), and [this book](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Race_Decoded/pa7BMqa8rGwC?hl=en&gbpv=1&printsec=frontcover) shows how some scientists currently view race), ethnicity, gender, and/or other identities. A simple Google search of ‚Äúsystemic racism in STEM‚Äù yielded over 2 million results while preparing this answer. We also have enough proof of that based on our recent global [\\#FedUpRising](https://www.theroot.com/a-timeline-of-events-that-led-to-the-2020-fed-up-rising-1843780800), [\\#ShutDownSTEM, and #ShutDownAcademia](https://www.shutdownstem.com/) events. Even one of the most prominent scientific journals in the US ([***Science***](https://science.sciencemag.org/)) published by the [American Association for the Advancement of Science](https://www.aaas.org/?_ga=2.241980417.2055961781.1597282108-261130309.1597067335) (AAAS) acknowledged this during their support earlier this summer of #ShutDownSTEM #ShutDownAcademia. The fact that we \\*continue\\* to see the ‚Äúfirst Black/Indigenous/Latinx \\[fill in with STEM professional/PhD/etc.\\]‚Äù provides more even more support for this ‚Äúclaim.‚Äù\n\nRead this [2018 article](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-76694-2_6) or [2019 article](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.3102/0013189X19831006) (which controls for many of the factors mentioned, like high school academic preparation for college), quantitative analyses about this issue. The [2017 Tech Leavers Study](https://www.kaporcenter.org/tech-leavers/) published by the [Kapor Center](https://www.kaporcenter.org/) provides one of the most comprehensive reports on racism, bias, and discrimination in the tech fields. As it relates to women/[womxn](https://medium.com/@knottyvibescompany/intersectional-feminism-101-what-is-womxn-36c0a3140126) in STEM, this is a complicated issue (often referred to as the [***double bind*** for womxn from BIPOC communities](https://www.aaas.org/news/thirty-five-years-after-double-bind-obstacles-remain-minority-women-stem)).

      "text": "I'm not entirely sure about latinx representation in STEM, but I figured out I would like to share my story.\n\nI am from Venezuela, one of the most, if not the most terrible country to live in in recent history. We have had an inflation rate of 1,698,488% (2018), 7500% (2019), and I honestly do not know what is going to be for 2020. \n\nI am good at math and I want to study computer science. I have 3.96 gpa (19.8/20), i have participated in intermational math contests (central, iberoamerican, IGO, and the IMO (altho in the latter I seriously messed up)). I am 3 time winner of gold medal in the national math olympiad.\n\nI AM DESPERATE. I need to scape out of my country to study abroad. I am sick and tired of this piece of land that dares to call itself a nation. Of course, my target is/was USA or unis with American education system. I have been in the process of applying to universities, and I have already spent 3 years on it. I took the SAT twice: 800 in math, 690 in reading in my last attemp on 2019. I applied to various unis and they either rejected me (NYUAD after waitlist, YALE-NUS directly) or said that I was not in the finacial position to attend (SUNY, Richmond, countless others).\n\nIt has been amazing to me the fact that only few few few selected universities have scholarships for latinx population, but a lot of them for Asian, African, or European. It seems to me that they think we do not exist, and unis beleive that DACA and undocumented are the only latinx population that exists. It looks like they do not care about those who are still in their countries. A lot of them are suffering. The few available grants to latinxs are directed to guys with political and comunity goals (e.g, you have to return to your country upon grad, have studies in political sciences, etc). I think most latinx STEM prospects do not have that focus, and neither I have it. So, I found myself in the middle of nowhere.\n\nUltimately, I blame no one but myself on my failure to find a university in which I would like to study. I will apply to the ones with need-blind policy this year, so hopefully everything goes smoothly. There is this amazing scholarship in East Tennessee State uni that I managed to obtain so that is a bit of hope at the end of the tunnel if I dont get to the top unis I am looking forward to.\n\nYet, I would like to point out that it is not easy to get in the university, it is difficult to do so as an international student, it is harder if you are latinx, and nearly impossible if you lack money. Latinamerican students usually have the last three characteristics.\n\n(P.d: I have some teammates and acquaitances that made it to MIT without having a single penny, so yeah, perhaps my lack of achievements blurs my objective perception on the matter)",

      "text": "Hi! A lot of the things you talked about in your original post are points I have never heard of, let alone considered. This is very eye opening for me, and for that I thank you.\n\nI have a couple of questions pertaining to the acceptance rates of people in colleges based on race. The statistics you mentioned state that the percentage of people of color in college who graduate with a PHD is only 5.4%, presently. This is very odd, since other statistics display that the acceptance rates of white people and people of color are quite similar (https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/pdf/coe_cpb.pdf). Disparity is present, but it's nowhere near the startling 5.4% that make it to graduating with a PHD. Do you think this difference could point to the root of the problem nit being primarily in the acceptance rates of students, but in the discrimination they face while attending classes?\n\n~~Secondly, do you think that racial disparity could be solved among college applicants via blind applications? This is anecdotal, but college applications I've seen have asked for your race and ethnicity. If one were to sift through the applications without knowing the race of any applicants, do you think this would better or worsen the problem?~~ EDIT: u/SunkCostPhallus, in what is very much an r/rimjob_steve -esque fashion, provided a link to a study that disproves this. It actually has the opposite effect, surprisingly, pointing to the problem being much deeper and more systemic than racism in the selection process. And I just realized I said the words \"rimjob steve,\" in a formal discussion and I can't stop giggling.\n\nAlso, what are your thoughts on the average SAT scores of minority groups, with the exception of Asian Americans, being lower than that of the white population? Something like that seems to point to the problem of racial disparity in academia being a much deeper problem than something that can be solved by changing the college system. It seems as though many systemic socioeconomic factors that cause disparity between races need to be changed in order to achieve actual equality, as opposed to something like Affirmative Action, which, while a good start, seemed to only be solving the problem at a surface level. What do you think? I'm no professional, and I'd much rather hear the empirical and even anecdotal data from those out in the field than hear the chatter of of the internet.",

          "text": "Huh. So it seems that things such as the SAT score disparity could be what really causes this bias, and not people being unconsciously racist when looking at the ethnicity portion of the application.\n\nIf this is the case, then things like meeting racial quotas and adding points to application scores aren't going to solve the problem at all. It'll get a lot of people accepted, that's for sure, but it won't get a lot of people to graduate, which is supported by the 5.4% graduate statistic.\n\nWhat would work best is probably allowing more federal funding and security towards schools in low income areas, especially since, between racial disparity being extremely present in housing (https://demographics.virginia.edu/DotMap/index.html, made by a pair of researchers in Duke University, Virginia, according to [this article](https://www.wired.com/2013/08/how-segregated-is-your-city-this-eye-opening-map-shows-you/amp)) and those same neighborhoods often being low income due to the practice of redlining, as seen [in this report by NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/10/19/498536077/interactive-redlining-map-zooms-in-on-americas-history-of-discrimination), people of color are vastly more likely to be impoverished than the white population. Thusly, the reason why we see consistently lower blind acceptance rates could be because of one race experiencing a consistently lower quality of primary and secondary education than the other.\n\nI'm not trying to push forward any narrative, just edit my standing in lieu of new data. Thanks for the link, I'll edit my comment to feature it.",

Summary: changing ONLY THE NAME on a CV to manipulate race and gender, the authors asked physics and biology professors at U.S. research institutions to score prospective postdoc candidates on competence, hireability, and likeability. Statistically significant disparities were found between some of the different racial and gender groups even though the CVs are otherwise identical. This offers evidence that this bias exists and could be keeping qualified minorities from advancing in their careers.\n\nThe questions you ask are important but so, so hard to answer with the definitiveness that you are looking for. Consider: what reasonable (and ethical) experiment could be performed to demonstrate causation (vs correlation)? You ask for evidence of systemic racism that controls for income, early education, etc.---but those are factors that are also embroiled with systemic racism. People and society are so incredibly complex. From my observation in reading the rest of this thread: we are all thirsty for the answers to \"why is this happening\" and \"how can we help.\" From the experts' responses, there is clearly no one universally true answer or panacea. We cannot wait for the Nature article that tells us that racism happens exactly because of X, Y, and Z before we start to listen to and validate Black and minority voices when they tell us that they feel uncomfortable or pushed out of academic spaces. Check out the American Institute of Physics' [TEAM-UP report](https://www.aip.org/diversity-initiatives/team-up-task-force) on factors that contribute to African-American attrition in undergrad physics/astronomy, and actions to remedy that.",

There are multiple issues to unpack in this question‚Äîand each issue is obviously multifaceted, so I cannot fully answer your question (and as the replies indicate). To your first point:  Yes, we all agree there is a ‚Äúdiversity problem‚Äù and many [folx](https://forfolxsake.com/what-does-the-term-folx-mean/) are interested in understanding why this problem persists and is pervasive in the US and globally. In the STEM fields and education, we use terms like [leaky or blocked STEM pipeline](https://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2018/02/02/581849526/leaky-pipelines-plug-the-holes-or-change-the-system), [broadening participation efforts](https://www.nsf.gov/od/broadeningparticipation/bp.jsp), or [diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts](https://www.aaas.org/programs/diversity-equity-and-inclusion-programs) to describe, study, and explain this so-called diversity problem. [Like some others in the field](https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2019/10/02/negative-consequences-pipeline-metaphor-stem-fields-opinion), I find the [pipeline metaphor problematic](https://slate.com/technology/2017/10/the-problem-with-the-pipeline-metaphor-in-stem-education.html). Nonetheless, it‚Äôs an issue scholars in the US, along with countries in Europe [(like The Netherlands](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/09500693.2018.1540897?needAccess=true)), Africa ([like Kenya](https://theconversation.com/why-fewer-kenyan-women-are-choosing-or-completing-stem-courses-91706)), and elsewhere study and say begins early in life‚Äîsome say [even before elementary school](https://hechingerreport.org/the-stem-pipelines-giant-hole-starts-before-kindergarten/).\n\nThe diversity problem is deeply rooted in [white supremacy](http://www.sceneonradio.org/tag/season-2/), [racist](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Stamped_from_the_Beginning/e_3cCgAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&printsec=frontcover) and sexist ideologies, and biases. To better understand these ideas and the myriad ways they affect our lives, with hopes of engaging anti-racist work, I‚Äôve curated [this list of resources](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1msBqreACDpFVynqA54L408tKyOepT-pXhdaL8bTtVNc/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nSystemic racism exists in our world, especially in STEM based on race ([not a biological construct](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/05/what-we-mean-when-we-say-race-is-a-social-construct/275872/), and [this book](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Race_Decoded/pa7BMqa8rGwC?hl=en&gbpv=1&printsec=frontcover) shows how some scientists currently view race), ethnicity, gender, and/or other identities. A simple Google search of ‚Äúsystemic racism in STEM‚Äù yielded over 2 million results while preparing this answer. We also have enough proof of that based on our recent global [\\#FedUpRising](https://www.theroot.com/a-timeline-of-events-that-led-to-the-2020-fed-up-rising-1843780800), [\\#ShutDownSTEM, and #ShutDownAcademia](https://www.shutdownstem.com/) events.

The [2017 Tech Leavers Study](https://www.kaporcenter.org/tech-leavers/) published by the [Kapor Center](https://www.kaporcenter.org/) provides one of the most comprehensive reports on racism, bias, and discrimination in the tech fields.

      "text": "Hi, this is Anne-Marie - the department is one of the most critical locations to promote equity in STEM. I have addressed some strategies in another answer. I would add that minimizing (or eliminating) the role of the GRE in graduate admissions and being more open-minded about potential for graduate study are important to diversify graduate departments. In the U.S., BIPOC undergraduates are overwhelmingly concentrated in schools that are less well-resourced and less selective. At the graduate level, those responsible for admissions should not hold it against students that they might not have participated in internships or research opportunities that these schools did not have the resources to provide. Similarly, undergraduate admissions should take a more expansive view of the potential of BIPOC students to contribute to scientific fields, rather than focus on narrow (and inaccurate) metrics like test scores. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDepartment faculty and leaders can make special efforts to fund BIPOC students to attend professional conferences like SACNAS [https://www.sacnas.org/](https://www.sacnas.org/)  Faculty can make special efforts to connect BIPOC students to their networks - it is often through these personal connections at spaces like conferences that students might meet the first scientist from a background like them. In other words, connecting BIPOC students with inter-institutional networks and professional associations focused on BIPOC students can provide other avenues for fostering a sense of belonging as scientists. Culturally responsive pedagogy that takes into account role models, histories, and perspectives of BIPOC is also key. What this can look like is incorporating reading and exercises about these issues in science classes, rather than assuming that they will get covered in social science, ethnic studies or other classes. So much emerging scholarship has connected STEM with social issues, and incorporating this scholarship into curricula would provide more opportunities for students to see themselves reflected in the coursework they take. Right now I am working with a large network of Hispanic-Serving Institutions that are very involved at the department level in raising attainment of BIPOC and Latinx students. They are engaged in practices like peer tutoring in introductory classes, intergenerational research groups, and strategic mentoring of graduate students to apply for NSF fellowships. These institutions graduate higher shares of Latinx students than the average institution in the U.S.  This initiative (website below) provides an example of departments that take a multipronged approach with many strategies to expand opportunities for BIPOC students:\n\n[https://cahsi.utep.edu/about/](https://cahsi.utep.edu/about/)",

Even after the story broke, she changed her name to sound African and to my knowledge is still pretending.\n\nYou can't stop white people like these, simply because they are more invested in the con than anyone else is. I'd argue the more important priority is preventing opportunities meant for BIPOC from going to non-BIPOC who are being honest about their identities but looking for a leg up, or also creating more opportunities for BIPOC in the first place.",

While they are pursuing a PhD in STEM, most or almost none elect to pursue fundamental research as a career, i.e. research scientist level or professor level, but elect to go into industrial jobs or those tied with the financial sector. Ultimately, there's a real lack of representation from undergraduate, all the way up to professor level. To me it seems like the problem begets more of the problem, in some kind of terrible feedback loop.\n\nEdit: To me, outreach does not seem to be a solution by itself. I think it's necessary to combine outreach with stronger incentives in hiring. To add, these incentives are there at the graduate level, but they are still very weak compared to fellowships that are obtainable by students who have had better outcomes at the undergraduate level - which will obviously be skewed towards those who come from a better financial background.",

The problem is that orgs and agencies that collect nationally representative data typically do not prioritize or invest in oversamples of AI/AN students.\n\nMost scholars that use secondary data, particularly federal data, have no say with regard to survey questions or sampling. We can't change what has already been collected, but we can work to change future data collection.

      "text": "This term, I took a climate change class through my college's geology department. For one of our first labs, we took a sediment core from a kettle lake in Minnesota, and spent a few weeks afterward reconstructing climate data for the ten thousand years or so that the sediment had recorded. We were even able to do it with some degree of accuracy--though most of our data was qualitative with respect to the rest of the core. My question, though, is about fires and charcoal as they function as proxies for droughts. In my understanding, charcoal remnants are more common in periods of higher water fall, as there might be more biomass to burn. Of course, there would nearly always be *some* biomass to burn, even if MN was a grassland at the time of a fire. From our core however, we found that the amount of charcoal was tied to periods of less drought, which isn't the most logical connection in the world; I would have expected more fires in times of drought. What is your understanding of the fire-drought connection? In this time of global climate change, what do you think we can expect in terms of large scale fires? Already, there has been some speculation that the fire season in the western US is increasing in length, and the fires are more severe.   \nMy second question is a bit more personal; how did you all get involved in these studies? I walked onto campus in September sure that I was going to be a biology major, but I'm really interested in these sorts of climate studies, and I'm thinking that majoring in chemistry or geology might be a better route to this field. What's your opinion? Or, does it even matter what I choose as my undergraduate major--between those three options--as I plan to study beyond my undergraduate years?  \nThanks a bunch, this is a really interesting topic for an AMA!",

But that doesn't matter.  What matters is that the climate does sometimes go through periods of little warming. It has happened in the past, and it will happen in the future, and we know that and see such behavior in our models from time to time.  The current period of slow warming is due to some combination of unusual external conditions over that time period, including a deeper than usual solar cycle minimum, a series of small volcanic eruptions that collectively had some effect, and changes in anthropgenic aerosol pollution, combined with a contribution from the normal natural variability of the climate.  The external forcing contributions were unknown and undocumented as of the time a few years ago when the world's climate modeling groups did their most recent projections of the future that were the basis of the most recent IPCC report. Natural variability of the climate, which happens in many ways, is chaotic in nature and thus it is inherently difficult if not impossible to predict such temporary fluctuations much before they begin to occur.  Climate models produce such decadal variability, but at random times in their long-term records as befits a chaotic system. I can predict that my favorite baseball team will have a 5-game losing streak or lose 8 out of 10 games sometime during the season, but I can't predict when, and it has little to do with the more important question of whether they are going to win the pennant. The important thing is that climate change is not something to be evaluated year-to-year - as is so often the case in the media, which makes a big deal out of whether the current year is or is not the warmest on record - or even decade to decade, just as it is important not to evaluate my favorite team on what they did this week, but rather on what they do for the entire season.  Scientists who do research on climate change look at changes over many decades, typically a half century or more, as the signature of human-influenced climate change.  If the climate does not warm over the first 50 years of the 21st Century, then we will have something interesting to explain that current models do not project.  But the current hiatus, especially once one incorporates the most recent years' forcings, is not outside the bounds of what climate models envision can happen at times.\"\n\nGavin Schmidt:\n\"...There are multiple ways to measure the warming of the surface; there are at least 4 separate and mostly independent records from\nthe UK Hadley Center, the US NCDC (NOAA), NASA (GISTEMP) and the Berkeley Earth effort, as well as a couple of hybrid records. In all cases, there is a warming over the last 17 years (1997-2014) that ranging from 0.045 to 0.117 ¬∫C/dec, although the uncertainty in short term trends is relatively high (+/-0.1¬∫C/dec, 2 sigma). All of these trends are also consistent with the longer term\ntrend of ~0.17¬∫C/dec up to 1997. Thus it is not accurate to say there has been no warming. There are three other records of satellite-derived temperatures which estimate changes in the lower levels of the atmosphere (around 3 to 5 km above the surface), which have substantial structural uncertainties, their trends over the same period (1997-2014) are -0.01 to 0.09¬∫C/dec, with twice as much uncertainty (+/-0.2¬∫C/dec, 2 sigma). It is solely the first one of these that Senator Cruz is referring to. Additionally, ocean temperatures are clearly warming at the surface and at the sub-surface. Thus, to conclude that the planet is not continuing to warm requires picking the record with the lowest warming, ignoring the surface completely, and paying no attention to the uncertainties.\"\n\nAlso, along with the surface temperature, we're seeing lots of other indicators that show that the warming is continuing: declining land and sea ice, increased humidity, increased sea levels, increased ocean heat content, etc.\n\nhttp://cpo.noaa.gov/warmingworld/",

For example, you as a layman ask a simple question like, \"Well Ben, how much did your company earn last quarter?\" \n\nI will provide you with a simple answer, but the truth is much more complicated. There's hold backs, charge backs, crazy billing cycles, and really weird details that are contracted with customers. You are expecting a black and white definite number, but the number is actually gray and approximate. However, if you don't believe the number I give you is good, the alternative is that there is some vast conspiracy of accountants. \n\nThe same goes for science. We'd still be bashing rocks together to make fire, and there wouldn't be a goddamn global warming problem, because humanity would be far more worried with problems like avoid being eaten, not starving, and not freezing to death. That we trust science and turn on a light switch and get on an airplane, but suddenly we somehow believe that there is a vast conspiracy of scientists regarding climate change is laughable. \n\nSo save your breath. Anyone who knows that 99.9% of scientists agree on climate change and the effect of rising levels of CO2 and chooses to deny it - is frankly not willing to listen to whatever logical argument you are going to provide. \n\nMore, knowing that there's climate change and being able to do something about it are completely different things. You may as well tell someone to stop breathing.\n\nUnfortunately, the nature of humanity is energy based. As an example, when Miami (where they aren't allowed to say 'global warming' or 'climate' change') begins to sink, in crisis, the will seek a technological solution, like concrete sea walls. The concrete alone will contribute billions of tons of CO2 to the atmosphere.",

      "text": "Hey, engineering and scientists unite!\n\nBut to answer your question, there are three reasons I don't like solar as the One True Solution to our issues right now.  That said, let me also go on the record right here and state that I feel that solar will be one of many *partial* solutions to electricity generation in the coming days.  \n\nFirst reason: it's not reliable.  Yeah, yeah, everyone loves to say this, but it's true: solar is a great plan across places like the American Southwest and in equatorial regions (or, perhaps, in Spain/the Med), where long stretches of sun are common, broken by extremely infrequent, intense storms or reliable, small storms (e.g. every day for 20 minutes).\n\nSecond problem: lack of storage capabilities.  We're making a lot of progress with this one, but we don't yet have the ability to store energy at even a local power grid kind of scale without ruinously expensive (and chemically nasty) batteries, and I don't even think those are all that effective, meaning that solar power can take the load off more conventional methods, but that the other methods still have to be in place to get power at night/when it's cloudy/etc.\n\nThird and final problem: solar panels are hideously ugly to manufacture.  Perhaps some of this one has been cleared up, but the old-style photovoltaics common a few years ago involved producing huge amounts of chemical waste that I'm not eager to release en masse.  It's one of the unfortunate side-effects of the electronics industry, I'm afraid, and part of why the US component industry collapsed a while back (environmental regs).  To make it worse, solar panels have a very limited life, and to the best of my knowledge don't recycle all that well, so we have to continuously produce lots of chemical waste to replace the solar panels in service, etc.\n\nAll of that said: _I WANT TO SEE MORE SOLAR IN USE_.  Even with the issues I just mentioned, they could reduce the load on the main plants by a significant margin (I'd guess 10-30%) even in the bad regions, and burning that much less coal/natural gas/whatever is still a heck of an improvement. \n\nAny questions?",

Energy leaves the earth as electromagnetic radiation, primarily in the infrared, because the earth is relatively cool (look up \"black body radiation\" and \"thermal radiation\" on wikipedia for more info). The rate of energy flow in an out is in balance, and the earth's temperature is in equilibrium.\n\nCO2 absorbs in the infrared, meaning that the amount of energy leaving the earth decreases as more CO2 is added to the atmosphere. Since the amount of energy coming in is the same, this causes the amount of energy (heat) in the earth to increase, which then increases the rate of heat loss due to thermal radiation, until it once again equals in the rate of heat gain, and the earth is at a new, higher, equilibrium temperature.\n\nOf course in real life, there are many more variables than just the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere, so climate scientists have spent a lot of time and effort looking to see if there is a correlation between average global temperature and CO2 concentration, as well as CO2 concentration and the thermal radiation spectrum of the earth, and they have found, unsurprisingly, that there is a very strong correlation.

      "text": "Luke here, what a great (and open ended) question. \n\ntl;dr in two ways: Gravity and the Weak force. \n\nI'm going to go off on one, read as far as you can be bothered, and there's lots more interesting details than I will include here!\n\n**Gravity:** I'll briefly mention gravity, because I'm mostly just being pedantic. The phenomenon of neutrino flavor change demonstrated that neutrinos have mass---really, we are only currently able to measure mass differences, we know that at least two of the masses are non-zero---so if they have mass, they will feel the pull of gravity. **Practically, their masses are so miniscule, that this doesn't really end up being considered** (unless there turn out to be very heavy neutrinos that we haven't yet detected, but this team isn't actively hunting for them).\n\n**Weak force:** The weak (nuclear) force is the main way that they interact with other matter. **The weak** force is mostly fairly removed from everyday experience (which is all gravity and electro-magnetic forces), but it **is responsible for one form of nuclear decay**, where a neutron decides it would be better off being a proton and swaps its charge by kicking out a electron and an electron antineutrino (read 'decides' as 'is energetically favorable'). As with many things in physics, we can look at this process from a slightly different angle and realise its applicable elsewhere. If instead of a neutron spontaneously deciding to be a proton and losing an antineutrino and a charged electron, a neutrino comes along and convinces a neutron it would really be better off as a proton, and in doing so, the neutrino itself becomes an electron‚Ä¶ this is really the same process, but reversed in time. Things can get more complicated when the neutrino is really persuasive and either excites the neutron into some more exotic state, which then decays to produce more than just a proton (often a pion). Beyond that, the neutrino can talk directly to the constituent quarks of the neutron and end up blasting it apart into a shower of exotic particles! (More precisely, 'more persuasive' here means more energy and momentum transfer from the neutrino/electron side of things to the proton/neutron time of things). \n\n**Other Details:** So far I've been describing **'charged current' weak interactions**, which involve an electron neutrino and a charged electron, you can also have weak force interactions that do not result in a charge change, so-called **'neutral current'**, the simplest is where a neutrino comes in and bumps a proton or neutron, but doesn't cause it to change charge. **Since we cannot directly detect neutrinos, and we usually rely on seeing an electron and proton seemingly appear from nowhere** and thus infer that there was a neutrino interacting, these neutral current interactions are often harder to 'use'.\n\n**I've been talking in terms of electrons and electron neutrinos, but everything is equivalent with muon- and tau- neutrinos.** One final thing that I'll add on that is: when you have a 'charged current' interaction, some of the energy of the incoming neutrino must be 'used' to give mass to the produced electron, muon, or tau particle. Electrons are super light, and so for neutrino energies that we play with on T2K, this isn't much of an effect. Muons are quite a bit heavier, and so for some low energy muon neutrinos, they are energetically not allowed to interact via a 'charged current' interaction because there is not enough energy to 'bump' the neutron \\*and\\* produce the mass of a muon. On T2K, most of the neutrinos that we see are muon-flavor and we know this because we see muons in our detectors. **The main result that we recently reported on looked for electron neutrinos 'appearing' in our beam of mostly muon neutrinos, however, most neutrino flavor change in our experiment causes tau neutrinos to be produced**, at our energies, tau neutrino charged-current interactions are energetically not allowed, and so we never see tau particles. Remember though, that 'neutral current' reactions do not produce a charged electron/muon/tau, and are thus not energetically restricted in the same way. So by actively looking for neutral current reactions, we can check that the total number of electron-, muon-, and tau-neutrinos doesn't change (and **looking for such changes is one way that we search for so-called 'sterile' neutrinos in some experiments, they are called sterile because they don't interact via charged or neutral current interactions and so we don't see them**).\n\nThere's so much more, and worrying about how neutrinos interact with matter is a decent sized theoretical and experimental field, that we usually just use as a 'tool' to try and make sure we understand the neutrino flavor change processes that we think we are seeing. But I'll leave it there for now.",

This means that neutrino 'telescopes' don't look like what comes to mind with the word telescope.\n\nHere's a few pictures of some neutrino telescopes:\n\nSuper-K: [https://imgur.com/RY1NXit](https://imgur.com/RY1NXit) \\[1\\]\n\nIceCube: [https://imgur.com/QcQ5iCG](https://imgur.com/QcQ5iCG) \\[2\\]\n\nANTARES: [https://imgur.com/mwFSKp3](https://imgur.com/mwFSKp3) \\[3\\]\n\nSo IceCube, which is a detector built from strings of light sensors suspended in the Antarctic Ice, would 'see' something like this ([https://imgur.com/riqIMTa \\[2\\]](https://imgur.com/riqIMTa)) from a high energy neutrino interacting within the detector. From analysing the time and positions of such energy deposits a general direction of the neutrino can be determined (red deposits are earlier so where its coming from). The sources of neutrinos that IceCube study either come from 'cosmic rays' (high energy particles hitting the Earth's atmosphere and producing showers of exotic particles, some of which are neutrinos) or other 'astrophysical' sources, i.e. neutrinos come from SPACE. These experiments can then build up maps of where things seem to be coming from 'out there', and they look a bit like this [https://imgur.com/WYDdHQF](https://imgur.com/WYDdHQF) (\\[3\\] this is actually ANTARES data‚Ä¶ the IceCube slides took out Firefox on my laptop with their awesomeness density)!\n\nIn addition, neutrino telescopes are waiting expectantly for a local supernova to study. An interesting property of supernovas is that because neutrinos don't like to interact with anything, they escape the supernova before the light, and the wave of neutrinos produced will reach the earth before the light (as they travel at near enough the speed of light). While we want to study the neutrinos themselves for the insight they can give about supernova, they will also give us an early warning that we're about to 'see' the light from a stellar collapse.

In fact, it is often easier to figure out what's going on from below.\n\nThey see neutrinos produced in the atmosphere: high energy cosmic rays smack into the atmosphere creating huge showers of secondary particles including many neutrinos. In fact, depending on the energy of the neutrino and how much Earth they go through, they may do this weird thing called oscillations which SuperK discovered in 1998 shocking the particle physics community. Kajita from SuperK was eventually awarded a Nobel prize for this along with McDonald from another experiment called SNO.\n\nThey see neutrinos from the sun. SuperK, SNO, Borexino, and others have measured solar neutrinos which also exhibit oscillations, but for very different parameters than those in the atmosphere. In fact, SuperK took a shitty picture of the sun in neutrinos, which is very cool.\n\nYou can also see neutrinos from beyond our solar system, but they are rarer so you need a bigger detector, that's what IceCube is. It has detected something beyond the atmospheric flux and it is known to be extragalactic, but that's about all we can say so far. They've measured about 100 neutrinos from space, but they have a rich neutrino program including great atmospheric measurements.\n\nSuperK (and two other experiments) also measured neutrinos from a nearby supernova in 1987. Despite barely being on and not really expecting it and only measuring a total of about 25 neutrinos among the three neutrinos, the data set compromises the most important supernova data set to date. We are eagerly awaiting the next local SN. It has already happened and the shock wave is propagating towards us, we just don't know when it will hit. We're much more prepared now as there is the [supernova early warning system (SNEWS)](https://snews.bnl.gov/) wherein anyone can sign up for an email alert if any neutrino detector measures something. If one goes out I assure you neutrino people everywhere will go bonkers! We're much more prepared now, we have many detectors connected with low latency SN triggers to notify everyone around the world extremely quickly, and are expected to see thousands to millions of events depending on how close the SN is.\n\nThere is lots more neutrino astrophysics to do too such as the diffuse supernova neutrino background which should be finally measured in the next few years, the cosmic neutrino background which would provide a wealth of information about the early universe and neutrinos but is insanely hard to measure, and the cosmogenic neutrino flux from ultra high energy cosmic rays scattering off the cosmic microwave background which would break key degenercies in our understanding of cosmic ray physics.",

It helps that doing these scientific experiments delivers genuine societal benefit in several ways. \n\nFirst is the big-picture blue-skies research benefit.

By finding out more about the universe you get the paradigm shifts that lead to technologies no one ever thought of before.\n\nSecond is the technological spin-outs.

The particle physics one that we like to remind everyone of is that the world-wide-web (which is the code that underpins a lot of the internet) was invented to let particle physicists share data with each other.  The accelerators that we developed to study high energy particles are also now used in a type of cancer therapy called proton therapy that can treat tumours while doing less damage to surrounding tissue than conventional radiotherapy.\n\nThird is the people. Particle physics experiments train hundreds of students and early career researchers in high-tech skills like machine learning, data analysis and high-speed electronics. A large fraction of these people go out into industry and apply these cutting-edge techniques to help companies and make the economy stronger. It‚Äôs also not just those who work on the experiment who we reach. A large fraction of physics undergraduates, when asked why they went into physics, say that it was particle physics or other large-scale fundamental physics experiments that inspired them, so by continuing to answer the big interesting questions we keep drawing talented young people to STEM subjects.\n\nFinally, you often find that people in government also find the questions we‚Äôre answering really interesting. There‚Äôs a fantastic story about a UK prime minister fighting to keep funding of one of the big international particle physics labs purely because they thought that it was fascinating.\n\nYour other questions are probably more directed at my theorist colleagues, but while we never like to say never the way we investigate questions like these is by trying to see what it looks like when we try to formulate the proposed solution in maths and whether the resulting theory predicts something that agrees with what we see.",

If the receiver knowns what any given combination of these three types means, and we know exactly what combination will be present when it reaches our target  then when they detect it they can know what information is attempting to be passed. But with neutrinos low interaction i don't think this would ever be used in say a quantom computer, unlike light which we can and will detect if it is shined at a sensor, neutrinos just pass through the sensors the vast majority of the time which is why their sensors are huge underground tanks of water. Just to detect 1 or 2 of the trillions that pass through at a given moment.  So i think the short answer to part 1 would be no, we couldn't feasibly use neutrinos to pass intentional information on to someone. The information detected neutrinos carry is more about energy levels that tell us the source of the neutrino. Which leads in to part two, cosmic rays are highly energized particles flying through space, when they collide with the atoms in the very tops of earths atmosphere they explode into all manner of energy and particles, some of which turn into neutrinos and then fly through earth and out the other side into space. The detectors we have here on earth sometimes manage to catch a few of them, and when that happens they can deduce the energy levels and therefore the source of that neutrino, some labs are looking for cosmic ray neutrinos, some labs are looking for solar neutrinos that are created by our suns fission, and some labs like this one are creating neutrinos themselves to study the behavior and oscillation of neutrinos as a whole.",

The other third is discussing the results of the programming, or what programming you have to do next week---this balance changes a lot as you advance along the academic career path. There is a lot of freedom in this field to exercise, and develop computational skills, and there's a great mix of people who love programming for programming's sake, those who like to write good code to solve a problem, but don't actually care too much about the architecture of their solution, and those who treat programming as an unfortunate necessary evil to do the measurements that they want to do. \n\nSpecifically talking about machine learning (ML), a lot of the techniques that are now becoming mainstream, have been used in one form or another for many years in particle physics, mainly for 'selecting the needles in the haystack' for rare processes with a lot of background noise. Specifically in my experience, experimental neutrino people (and HEP more widely) are now playing catch-up and finding uses for the ML algorithms and tools from the new 'big data' industry. Such tools are incredibly useful and if you have experience with them, you will be well equipped to make valuable contributions (there are of course myriad of ways that you can make valuable contributions without being an ML expert).\n\nSo, unfortunately I don't have any specific resources to recommend, but I will say that if you keep feeding your love of computational techniques, you will find applications for them everywhere, but especially in physics.",

      "text": "From Luke. No need to apologize! In kind, I won't try and answer any that I don't have a useful or at least semi-informed answer for.\n\n1) The key point is that we infer they must have mass because we have observed neutrino flavor change (or oscillation). We think that this should only happen if there are three neutrinos with different masses. The experiment that I work on is sensitive to one of these mass differences. So, if we know they have mass, then they are expected to travel at less than the speed of light. However, because the masses are soooooo tiny, we cannot measure how different from the speed of light they do travel by just measuring the timing. So, we haven't yet observed that specifically, but we very much expect it to be true from other observations indicating that they have mass. If they have mass, they should be affected by gravity, and thus black holes, but again, because the mass is so small, this isn't something that (as far as I know) has been observed.  \n\n\n3) I tried to ELI5 here [https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/hng0ce/science\\_discussion\\_series\\_we\\_are\\_a\\_team\\_of/fxbb4vu?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/hng0ce/science_discussion_series_we_are_a_team_of/fxbb4vu?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) But very basically: it takes protons, thumps them into a thin wall, focuses the stuff that comes off into a second 'beam', this beam very quickly decays to produce neutrinos and 'stuff', we then put a very thick wall in the way so that everything except neutrinos stop. Only neutrinos make it through the wall because they interact so weakly, so you end up with a proton -> neutrino converter.\n\n4) We study anti-neutrinos! So, in 3) I said that we focus the unstable particles, we do this with an electromagnet. It can focus either charged or negatively charged particles, depending on which way we run electricity through it. If we focus positive particles we end up with mostly muon neutrinos, and if we focus negative particles we end up with mostly muon antineutrinos. This is critical to our research, what we are ultimately looking for is differences in neutrino flavor change and antineutrino flavor change, we can only do this well if we can run the beam in both configurations. \n\n5) I won't go into too many details here, as its a very open ended (but great) question, but in terms of the theory, swapping things around like this either makes interactions impossible (you might write down something that doesn't conserve electric charge, for example), or it ends up being a different process that you are describing with the same model. e.g. Neutrinos in our beams hitting matter in our detectors vs. nuclear decays producing antineutrinos and matter.\n\n6) The phenomenon of neutrino oscillation is sometimes described as the longest scale quantum process that we know of. So, yes, they travel like superposed waves over very long distances (hundreds of km on Earth-based experiments) and then we see them interacting in a defined flavor state in our detectors (particle-like).\n\n8) We shoot our neutrino beams down to account for the curvature of the earth, so yes, antineutrinos travel through the earth. But also neutrinos from many other sources (cosmic rays hitting our atmosphere, astrophysical sources, nuclear reactors, bananas) are produced all the time and travel on their merry way through the Earth, our bodies, whatever tries to get in their way. With regards to the antimatter asteroid, Randall Munroe answers a similar question far far better than I ever could, here: [https://what-if.xkcd.com/114/](https://what-if.xkcd.com/114/)  \n\n\nFinally, always expect whimsy from physicists.",

      "text": "Luke here, great question, short answer is 'no'. T2K (and other experiments probing similar physics) are not sensitive to the fermionic nature of the neutrino. For that, you need to look 'neutrinoless double-beta decay', which is a nuclear decay process that, if observed, would suggest that neutrinos are their own antiparticle. There are a number of experiments looking for this, I'll link the one with my favorite backronym: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAJORANA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAJORANA)\n\nOn the sterile front, there are certain sterile neutrinos that if they did exist, would be observable in T2K data, but we currently see no evidence of them. There are a number of experimental 'anomalies' that models include sterile neutrinos can be twisted to explain. As yet, there isn't a compelling indication that a single simple model can explain all the anomalies, and more complicated models with many 'tuneable' details always have to undergo a lot of scrutiny, because if you build in enough flexibility to a model, you can explain anything. None of this is to say that the observed anomalies are not a result of sterile neutrinos, just that we need to keep searching. On that note, I'll highlight two types of experiments that are looking for evidence of sterile neutrinos, that I am not involved with, but am personally excited to see future results from. Firstly, the short baseline program at Fermilab (where I am based day to day, near Chicago) [https://sbn.fnal.gov/](https://sbn.fnal.gov/), and nuclear reactor experiments like PROSPECT (https://prospect.yale.edu/) and STEREO (https://www.stereo-experiment.org/).\n\nThere's so much more on this topic, but it is not my area of expertise, and the experiments that I work on are only very weakly sensitive. Maybe /u/jazzwhiz has more to add :D",

That said, such a measurement is extraordinarily difficult.\n\nAs for steriles, yeah, T2K isn't really optimal to measure this sort of thing. Basically, what T2K measures depends really strongly on a couple of parameters that we don't know yet. So all of the \"information\" they extract goes to constraining those. If you throw more things in the mix you get fucked and can't tell anything. The are loads of experiments looking for sterile neutrinos across a huge range of parameters. The 1 eV^2 region is popular (in large part because that's where a lot of experiments are looking) with short baseline reactor experiments leading the way. There is also the short baseline accelerator neutrino program at Fermilab which is probably the state of the art for this. Also, due to a neat resonance, IceCube at E=1 TeV has good sensitivity to these parameters.\n\nThat said, sterile searches are by no means limited to the 1 eV^2 region. There are lots of searches at the keV scale using supernova, the MeV scale by precision pion and kaon measurements, GeV scale using beam dumps, and higher (where they no longer have to be sterile) at the LHC. There are also lots more that I've forgotten.",

      "text": "**Lauren** \\- Firstly, considering the most surprising neutrino physics discovery, given where we started many years ago, the most surprising discovery could be that neutrinos are not massless like predicted by the standard model predicts. The observation of neutrino oscillation showed us that neutrinos can change flavour as they travel over a certain distance. Now we know that neutrinos are actually a superposition of the 3 flavour and mass states, it‚Äôll be interesting to figure out the ordering of the. A confirmation of the mass ordering would lead to the determination of whether the neutrino is indeed it‚Äôs antiparticle. No doubt there will be more surprises along the way!\n\n[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nuclphysb.2015.12.015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nuclphysb.2015.12.015)\n\nOn a more informal note, a personal, most surprising discovery is that, considering myself as someone who struggles with anxiety, I am now happy to travel solo across the world, to a foreign-speaking country (and live there for 2 years) - something that I could never have imagined several years ago.\n\n**Luke** here, honest answer: at 2 am, after four hours of fighting the compiler and getting some bit of code to run and produce a plot that looks better than you could have hoped it would, is great! I have such surprises once or twice a year, which you can take to be as an indicator of imposter syndrome or incompetency :p.\n\n**Patrick** \\- One of the things I would love to do before the end of my career is make a surprising discovery. The history of particle physics is full of surprises, but I‚Äôve not been directly involved in one. So far, my PhD, where I was looking for Higgs bosons decaying to dark matter, didn‚Äôt find evidence of the process. Also while starting to see indications that matter and antimatter neutrinos behave differently is really exciting, it‚Äôs been predicted as a possibility for several decades now. On a more prosaic level I think we all have moments where we feel like we‚Äôre not good enough to be surrounded by the other fantastic scientists we work with sometimes, so I remain endlessly pleasantly surprised that people are willing to keep paying me to play around investigating how the universe works!\n\n**Yoshi:** The process of discovery, where you simply do not know how the Universe is going to respond to the question (experiment) you have set up for it, and it finally gives you an answer, usually after many years, is always exciting. That answer can be ‚Äúsurprising‚Äù or not, but it makes me feel happy, either way.\n\nHaving said that, for my postdoc at Stanford, I worked on the KamLAND experiment which was the first to see reactor neutrinos oscillate, and as I told people I was thinking of working on that experiment, I recall some of them saying that it would be yet another reactor neutrino experiment that sees no oscillations ‚Äî so it certainly was a pleasant surprise when we got the experiment working and found that almost half the neutrinos had disappeared on the way to us from the reactors!\n\nSeeing electron neutrinos appear in a beam of muon neutrinos at T2K was a big discovery and surprise (it came many years earlier than it might have), but you could say that the biggest and even more pleasant surprise of all was meeting my now wife, a fellow collaborator on T2K!",

How do we know whether that was a neutrino or dark matter?\n\nFor an experiment like T2K, the neutrinos have such high energies so that these ‚Äúindications‚Äù are literally several metres in size, and we can also control and pulse the beam in time, to make sure it is neutrinos from our beam that we are seeing. So it really isn‚Äôt an issue for us.\n\nOther types of neutrino experiment, such as those looking at neutrinos from the Sun or nuclear reactors, have a much harder time, with their neutrinos having lower energies and being constant in time, more or less. Usually, we gather enough neutrinos so that their energies etc. give us more confidence that it is what we think we are looking at, and if there is a clear electron or muon emerging, that will also make it clear.\n\nBut it is probably actually the other way round; dark matter detectors are looking for such faint signals, such that it is those detectors that are going to be so sensitive that the neutrinos from the Sun are going to overwhelm the numbers of events they see.\n\nPhysicists love a challenge though, so those who are building dark matter detectors are not only looking at how to be able to distinguish neutrinos from their dark matter signal, but are also honing their designs to be able to measure neutrinos much better than current neutrino detectors can!\n\n\\- Patrick",

The first may sound obvious, and may be something you already do, but **I recommend reading; Science books, articles and news from any of the sciences you may be interested in.** It‚Äôs good to keep up to date with the latest discoveries in all fields. Widening your knowledge of physics, engineering, astronomy, chemistry etc. will help you to figure out specific areas of science that you may want to go into at university and PhD level. When it comes to physics, **sometimes it can be difficult to choose between experiments or areas, so being aware of exciting new physics and detector development can help you figure out the best experiment, topic or theory for you to work on.** I shared some links to a few books in reply to another question which you may find useful: **https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/hng0ce/science\\_discussion\\_series\\_we\\_are\\_a\\_team\\_of/fxbttoz?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x**\n\n**Another thing is coding. It‚Äôs good to start early!** We do a lot of programming in physics for data analysis, data acquisition or writing firmware, so learning a widely used programming language will kick start your early career. I recommend Python as it‚Äôs simple and easy to learn, has a lot of functionality and is pretty widely used by students and academics in University and PhD programs. **Learning to use Arduino and Raspberry Pi** microcontrollers and microcomputers is super fun! They‚Äôre great for home electronics projects and in particular, Arduino has a really nice IDE (Integrated Development Environment) which makes it really easy to learn. **Things like this will develop your creativity and your problem solving skills and allow you to make some really cool things!** My partner and I have so many gadgets in our home that are created using these types of things, for example, a TV remote made using an Arduino Uno and a few infra-red LEDs, and an automated door opener using a Raspberry-Pi.\n\nThe most important thing is to have fun with it!

That said, such a measurement is extraordinarily difficult.\n\nAs for steriles, yeah, T2K isn't really optimal to measure this sort of thing. Basically, what T2K measures depends really strongly on a couple of parameters that we don't know yet. So all of the \"information\" they extract goes to constraining those. If you throw more things in the mix you get fucked and can't tell anything. The are loads of experiments looking for sterile neutrinos across a huge range of parameters. The 1 eV^2 region is popular (in large part because that's where a lot of experiments are looking) with short baseline reactor experiments leading the way. There is also the short baseline accelerator neutrino program at Fermilab which is probably the state of the art for this. Also, due to a neat resonance, IceCube at E=1 TeV has good sensitivity to these parameters.\n\nThat said, sterile searches are by no means limited to the 1 eV^2 region. There are lots of searches at the keV scale using supernova, the MeV scale by precision pion and kaon measurements, GeV scale using beam dumps, and higher (where they no longer have to be sterile) at the LHC. There are also lots more that I've forgotten.",

      "text": "Its all contained, the target station is super radioactive because of all the 'mess'. But a few things, in the control room (with the ramen), there is a speaker that plays a sonar blip every time we receive a 'beam trigger' (the accelerator control room telling us they just sent a 'spill' of protons from the main ring down to our target station). Its quite soothing to hear every 1.6 seconds the \"pling\" letting you know that you're taking beam. We also have a live event display in the control room, so you occasionally see the products of neutrino interactions in the near detector that happened in the last few minutes.\n\nBut, at Fermilab, for one of the two neutrino beamlines (the Booster Neutrino beam), you can park your car next to the surface building above the target station and hear a 'thunk' every second or so when the beam is running. I didn't mention it in the above answer, but to make the most of the 'mess' of unstable particles, they are focused into a secondary beam. This focusing is done with very powerful electromagnets, often called neutrino 'horns' because of their shape. To produce the required magnetic field to focus this wayward mess of secondary particles you have to use a serious amount of current (order 300 kiloamps). We can't run that much current constantly through the horns as parts of them would melt, so this current is pulsed in time with the protons hitting the target. The magnetic field is so strong though, that it deforms the metal conductors of the horns which causes them to change shape slightly in time with the proton pulse. The thunk that you can hear if you stand/park in the right spot is the horns relaxing after this deformation!\n\nThere are also a lot of numbers on screen... I'll also dump the live NOvA event display (which is in another neutrino beam line at Fermilab, but all the principles are the same) [https://nusoft.fnal.gov/nova/public/](https://nusoft.fnal.gov/nova/public/) I don't think that the beam is running right now, so you will only see tracks from cosmic rays on the event display, but its all pretty similar to what you're looking at when the beam is running.\n\nI'll also add, Fermilab is open to the public, if you are ever in the Chicagoland area and have an afternoon to spend, come over. If you get in touch in advance (there are various people to email and numbers to call on the public site) you can get tours of many of the experiments!\n\n\\--Luke",

The intersection between security, privacy, and informed consent is enabling individuals to take control of their data so that it is only used for activities that they are comfortable supporting. Genetic data is special in that it is itself identifying of an individual just like other biometric data - but the concepts of control by the individual on its uses still apply. The trend towards increased control of ones data via data privacy legislation is much more widespread than the EU; many countries outside of the EU have recently pasted privacy laws similar to GDPR and California has passed the California Consumer Privacy Act or CCPA that comes into effect in 2020.",

The ethical issue would come in as to how they use this data. Say they screen you as a possible psychopath. Do they then put you on a watchlist?; detain you to a more controlled area?; deny you rights to a passport or visa? I suspect that laws will have to be passed, pushed by the WHO, for each country to adopt a kind of \"patient-doctor confidentiality\" clause, where the \"doctor\" would be the genetic library orginisation.\n\nThe utopian outcome would be that genetic data be soley used for the screening, detection, and curing of health-related issues.\nDystopia? Governments using genetic data to coralle populations like sheep into groups like \"high-risk\" or \"high medical expenses\", furthering the divide humans are currently facing.\n\nI know this post reads like some piece of fact statment rant, but all my point are open for discussion, please.

Really think about it. The laws that stem from such issues/changes are due to difficult and stringent conditions that have been practiced long as Hell. Seriously, there‚Äôs a saying that goes something like ‚Äúthe oldest profession is prostitution, the second is law‚Äù (I‚Äôd dare to add that music and/or war was probably before either of the former, but I concede). This really is a serious thing for future generations, are we walking down a road to oppression or to something greater than we are? What are the implications in fields like IVF?

      "text": "Hi, this is Bob Kain. This is a tough question to answer in a few paragraphs. MicroArrays, or arrays, typically assay, or interrogate, 700,000 predefined DNA bases in our genome. Each of us has over 6,000,000,000 bases in our genome, so the 700,000 bases does not represent a high percentage of our total genome. The 700,000  bases on a company's array are chosen based in part on the following 3 factors: a)Medically relevant, b) informative for ancestry purposes, or c) evenly distributed across the genome.\n\nSome health conditions are caused by single base changes in a single position in our genome.  Changes in these locations have a *first order* impact on our health. These locations are very valuable for medical research. Some conditions are caused by specific combinations of two or three changes in single bases in our genome. On the other hand some conditions could be informed by tens or even hundreds of different base changes in our genome. The latter conditions would in most cases require full DNA sequencing.\n\nThis discussion is complicated even more by the fact that some changes in our genome impact only our predisposition to diseases or conditions. These impacts can be thought of as *second order* impacts.\n\nYou are also raising a great point about the value of arrays for minority populations. Array content can be chosen to provide value to all populations. The content can also be chosen to optimize value only for a sub population. Additionally if the genomic diversity of a minority populations is less well known...  the array design would be hindered by that lack of knowledge.\n\nWe still have much to learn about the contribution of our genome to our health. By some estimates our genome, on average, contributes about 30% to our health. Surprisingly, according to one study, health institutions contribute only 10%. *The remaining 60% is contributed by Social Determinants*, including the decisions we make, our habits, and our environment. Only through collecting of this Social Determinant data can we hope to understand the complex interactions of these different factors and accelerate our understanding of what causes disease and reduces our quality of life. Only then will we truly enable Personalized Medicine.",

I am skeptical that it increases donor interaction with their data, I am concerned that participants in their program can see have their data used in a predatory manner.\n\nI am also skeptical about what the demand *will* be, however as co-founder George Church mentions, medical data is worth 10x that of your credit cards on the black market. As such, it is less about the *identities* of the individuals, but rather simply the need to source real information to perform big data analytics on populations.\n\nOf all the potential real-life (non-digitized) assets I see being cataloged on a blockchain, from real estate to supply management, I think genetic data is one of the best use cases after monetary and governance protocols.\n\nNonetheless, what do you mean regarding the data being used in a \"predatory manner\". That is the *point* of providing you with the private key to the encrypted genetic info. The data belongs to you, and you are free to approve your own sequence for research, and receive compensation directly rather than letting corporations cash in on your sequence.\n\nFurthermore, what assurances are currently afforded by companies like Ancestry and 23&Me to not use your data? The plain and simple fact that they didn't secure your permission? That hasn't stopped Facebook for doing exactly that deliberately, or many other corporations that neglected to adequately secure confidential information and it was stolen.\n\nThis seems like something of a no-brainer IMHO. Give individuals the rights and ability to privately sequence their genome, and utilize their own discretion how that data is used. It isn't some paltry \"oath\" from a neglectful company.\n\nI am also extremely disappointed this did not seem to warrant a response from a team of researchers, who claim to be dedicated to this very task. \"How do we solve this?\" Blockchain is the key, now you need developers to show you how!",

I am not an encyption expert, but my concern is once accsess is granted and the DNA is entered into an analysis pipeline it enters a \"black box\" DNA (fasta seq) in data out. You don't know what exatcly is being querried. For instance if your looking at Gene X and its relationship to Gene Y, but the two genes are on different chromosomes the researchers may ask for the entire seq of both chromosomes. Thats alot of data to examine and under the guise of gene X and gene Y research a lot else can be examined.\n\nAdditionally certain abberations in DNA mean very little from a reseach perspective IF the genotype is not associated with a phenotype. The only way to determine a phenotype is to exam the person/look at medical data. Predictive work and insilico research only go so far in a translational or biomedical context. If a novel SNP,mutation, etc is found it needs to be matched to a phenotype in order to establish clinical relevance.",

Data is essential for research which is essential for health discovery.  We believe in improving the whole continuum by bringing people to the table with privacy, choice, transparency. This is better for people AND can improve research by bringing in data from people's real world experiences and environments.

We all should care about keeping our date private both to protect ourselves and in the case of DNA data, to protect our relatives, our children, and our grandchildren. Unfortunately, in these times, many young people are not protective of their personal data. They are used to sharing very private information on social media. \n\nWhether a retired person cares about privacy or not though, they have the potential to provide significant value towards enabling health and quality of life research. Their contributions will go far in terms of leaving a legacy that future generations will benefit from. Models that protect their privacy while also enabling research exist today, to make this all possible. \n\nAlso, even though some people are not as concerned about privacy, another friction point relates to how fairly a person is being treated. Most studies show that 80% of people polled are willing to share data for health research. Many people however get upset or angry when they find that while they are being altruistic, the data aggregator is profiting disproportionately from their acts of kindness. If these data stewards discounted drugs developed from contributed data or shared commercial proceeds with those who voluntarily shared data, participation in studies and subsequent data contributions would increase.",

We are very proud of our contributions to making DNA data accessible and expanding the opportunity for human health and beyond. Discovery didn't seem to be following the same trajectory - personalized/precision health/medicine is still more vision than reality, and that's frustrating. Data siloing and the lack of inclusion of people in the research equation bothered us - research was lacking diversity, data scope/scale/breadth, longitudinally, real world info, etc. etc. - and data  empowered people are the key to this. Besides being the right thing to do (it's the person's data after all!), research can be improved when we honor people first. More people>more data>more research>more discovery>more diagnostics/interventions/preventions, etc > more value to people>repeat.  This is a virtuous cycle for Illumina and we are happy to work adjacent to them so we can all focus on what we're good at.",

Where I think alignment needs to happen is:  research needs to align w/ the mission of institute you are sharing with (if you share data w/ an institute whose mission is to cure cancer and they are researching genetic underpinning of intelligence, that's not aligned), what are the boundaries and terms of use, and is all this clear to you...are you truly¬†*informed*¬†of the risks and can you change your mind and permanently delete what you've shared (this is hard if your data has be resold or shared w/ another party).

The intersection between security, privacy, and informed consent is enabling individuals to take control of their data so that it is only used for activities that they are comfortable supporting. Genetic data is special in that it is itself identifying of an individual just like other biometric data - but the concepts of control by the individual on its uses still apply. The trend towards increased control of ones data via data privacy legislation is much more widespread than the EU; many countries outside of the EU have recently pasted privacy laws similar to GDPR and California has passed the California Consumer Privacy Act or CCPA that comes into effect in 2020.",

It seems there are numerous occasions when people's financial info, social info, personal info is hacked and there are no consequences for those who collected the information and were then hacked.   The only consequence falls upon the people that the information was collected from.  I understand why this information needs to be used for scientific reasons.

I am not an encyption expert, but my concern is once accsess is granted and the DNA is entered into an analysis pipeline it enters a \"black box\" DNA (fasta seq) in data out. You don't know what exatcly is being querried. For instance if your looking at Gene X and its relationship to Gene Y, but the two genes are on different chromosomes the researchers may ask for the entire seq of both chromosomes. Thats alot of data to examine and under the guise of gene X and gene Y research a lot else can be examined.\n\nAdditionally certain abberations in DNA mean very little from a reseach perspective IF the genotype is not associated with a phenotype. The only way to determine a phenotype is to exam the person/look at medical data. Predictive work and insilico research only go so far in a translational or biomedical context. If a novel SNP,mutation, etc is found it needs to be matched to a phenotype in order to establish clinical relevance.",

We went to community and disease groups that those individuals trusted and had them build the system within our white label customizable system.

      "text": "Dear 'lostintransactions' \nOf course the entire puzzle of this explosion will take years to put together, maybe it will never be entirely explained if the Chinese officials are not forthcoming. So yes, much of this is educated guesses (hypotheses). I will offer you two explanations of my cautionary approach, which is prudent in a situation such as this. 1) this 'experiment' has never been done before. These chemicals (and more that we don't know about) have never been combined in these quantities and set on fire. Nor will it be replicated to understand.  As a chemist with years of experience working with all types of chemicals, I put together reasonable assessments and predictions. That's what science is; even with all the control experiments in done, the data analyzed by multiple techniques, and experiments done in replicate, we can never say definitively and absolutely 'this is exactly what happened'. If we knew exactly, then we wouldn't need to do science any more.  \n\nMay Nyman\nEDIT: 9:31 PT  and I never put a #2...but I think #1 will suffice!  May Nyman",

Color correction based on a know frequency or combination of frequencies can also increase wavelength analysis accuracy. \n\nSource: studied under my professor who is pioneering the digital camera flame energy analysis through recorded wavelength processing, doing so with cheap digital camcorders. A certain amount of data is captured for known wavelengths provided by LEDs in a black box, the wavelength data is compiled extrapolated and analyzed using Mathematica, and a baseline for wavelength accuracy is reached using a kai function to find any predictable model for wavelength fluctuation for any given color. For example blues are the worst colors at being capture to the true hue, and therefore the blue calibration took much more recording/data to extrapolate an accurate model. I can't say why he's doing this research as that would constitute somewhat of a breach of confidentiality, I can only say that it does have specifically to do with flame wavelength analysis and therefore it is entirely possible. \n\nEven without having mentioned my source on this, as I said before an image is more than capable of being corrected to provide a wavelength analysis to within I'd say around 10-15nm tolerance given what I've seen of my professors research.",

      "text": ">600-800 tons would have 5 PSI overpressure out to 380-420 meters. So it's a bit high.\n\n600 tons, gives around 4.2 PSI at 380 meters, using a burst height of 5 meters.\n800 tons, we hit 5 PSI.\n\n3.8 PSI - 3.9 PSI is about where we could expect those blue sheet metal buildings to be totally destroyed the way they were.  Or maybe they were particularly poorly constructed and were knocked down with a lower overall speed.\n\nAssessing close to ground zero is difficult because many of the structures burned, which could have facilitated additional collapse above and beyond the explosion.\n\nThe \"best\" buildings for assessing the damage are the two reinforced concrete buildings I marked as \"gutted\" in the diagram.  Looking at pre-blast pictures, these were more heavily build than typical US office buildings, with more concrete facing.  The damage visible on those buildings is >5 PSI, from what I can tell comparing damage to Hiroshima damage surveys of similar buildings.  By >5 PSI, I mean, just barely though.  Not 10 PSI or even 8 PSI.  Probably 5-6 PSI.  Which puts us in the 400 ton range, with 600 tons being an upper boundary.\n\n>Still within one order of magnitude of each other so we're both on the right track\n\nYeah, that's the thing with cube law, you have to increase yield by 8x in order to double the damage.  That's why 20 tons is nothing to sneeze at, and a 1.3 kiloton explosion is only 4x as destructive as a 20 ton explosion.  \n\n>I don't know how to run calculations for thermobaric weapons but it does seem that they would more closely resemble this explosion. Anyone?\n\nI don't think it matters that much.  With thermobaric weapons, like BLEVES, the oxidizer is free, so a given weight of fuel can result in a bigger than expected bang, but I think the overall mechanics work out similar.  The thing I'm curious about, and I don't have the tools or physics background to work out, is what is the difference between pressure curve decay rates for say, a nuclear explosion (which is what I'm using - the old school Nukefx.xls calculator), vs. a high brissance explosive like RDX vs. a low order explosion/conflagration.\n\nI suspect - without any proof of course, that because this was a fast burn, the overpressure pulse was of longer duration than what would normally occurs with a high velocity explosion - and thus maybe more damaging for the given yield, which makes me wonder if we are talking about a sub 400 ton explosion after all.\n\nAnd then, again, we hear stuff like they had 800 tons of ammonium nitrate (which will go high order when it burns, especially when sprayed with water).  There were enough ISO tanks right at ground zero that could have easily contained 500+ tons of volatiles.  Plus the calcium carbide.  That place was a devils brew of things waiting to blow up.",

      "text": "It really depends on the perspective that you take. I'm an Industrial-Organizational Psychologist in training, and I sometimes have to admit that if you view psychology from a cognitive perspective as opposed to a behavioral perspective, then it's not technically a science. \n\nThanks to the cognitive revolution in the 70's, psychology has largely taken the cognitive perspective. What I mean by that is instead of viewing human behavior as a result of some observable phenomena, behaviors are viewed as the result of something that is theoretical and non-observable. For example, if a young student is banging on his desk at least once in every class, most psychologists might link that to his having a certain type of aggressive personality. However, you get caught in a never ending loop. Why is he banging on his desk? Because he has an aggressive personality. How do we know he has an aggressive personality? Because he bangs on his desk. From a scientific perspective, this is not science because the behavior (i.e. banging on his desk) is linked to a non-observable cause or phenomena (i.e. aggressive personality). To put this in a biological context, you wouldn't say a bacterium reproduces because it feels the natural urge to do so; you know it reproduces due to what we already know about reproduction that is observable and the observable changes that occur in the bacterium when it is undergoing reproduction. (Don't hate me for that last sentence, it's been a while since I've bee in biology.)\n\nOn the other hand, the behavioral perspective would observe that behavior and attempt to link it to a schedule of reinforcement, which is often some observable cause. In this case, you escape the tautological fallacy and have an observable behavior caused by something that is observable.\n\nSo, although most modern psychologists use the cognitive perspective, I wouldn't totally discount modern psychology as a non-scientific field. We use the same methods that all other scientists use, it just so happens that we use them to perform what a lot of scientists would describe as pseudo-science.",

      "text": "As a former PhD graduate student, the question of psychology as a science was an important question. I was introduced to this topic as learning that psychology was fighting for its rightful place in science. Sadly, that shift seemed more about getting money for departments than about generating better research and clinical applications. Psych wanted to abandon that which could not be reproduced by experiment--which means Freud, Rogers, Erikson, and Piaget were set aside. Cognitive behavioral approaches became the focus of research and clinical practice. CBT is a modality that fought its way into the mainstream, even if it's hard to get reimbursed. When I first learned about cognitive-behavioral theories, I hadn't given them much thought. But, this research seems among psychology's modern successes. \n\nAs much I was cynical about psychology as a scientific discipline, now 20 years later, have a different perspective. I have gained a respect for some of the research psychologists did. For example, the cognitive-behavioral research I read in the dark ages is revisited in light of the fact that antidepressants hadn't met the promises. Sure, ADs work for many, but repeated studies demonstrated that CBT may work as well. Not only that, I learned that so many therapeutics have unknown mechanisms of action. A lot of things work, but scientists don't know exactly why. That lends some credence to psychology. As long as the psychological phenomenon can be reproduced by different researchers and in different conditions, then it's worth looking into. For example, the placebo effect is well known and documented and continues to generate new studies and debate. \n\nPsychology continues to be the main discipline that considers human agency and hope. \nSo many medical conditions still are without answers and psychology approaches--getting support, staying optimistic, and consider person-centered approaches are concepts psychology embraces. Psychology works well with other sciences, including medicine. When my father was diagnosed with terminal cancer, we brought in hospice, which combined state-of-the-art palliative care with psychological counseling. I doubt hospice would be as effective without the psychological components. Imagine being delivered a cocktail of \"evidence-based\" medicines that were guaranteed to work in relieving pain. Imagine that cocktail was administered without dialogue or choice. It would be crazy to think that patients should simply accept a treatment because X, Y, Z high-impact journals published it. Psychology (collaborative decisionmaking) is part of the equation. Something as fundamental as \"bedside manner\" is a mix of psychology, ethics, and common sense. \n\nPsychology is a flawed discipline, but it works well when combine with other scientific disciplines to be useful to people. Psychology examines human behavior, which contains practically all of human existence.",

That just begs for better methods of scientific investigation.\n\nTake it from the inverse position: would the fact that it's hard to make observations about what's going on in the brain and how our motivations steers our thoughts and actions, make it ok to just ignore psychology as a field of study? Because it's hard to make definitive statements the study of the human mind would not be worth it?\n\nI think the fact that it is so hard makes it even more valuable as a topic because we're dealing with complex behaviour by a mind that has not really evolved to live in the kind of world we built for ourselves.\n\nSo, yes, with a lot of caution and begging for good questions, good experiments and honest conclusions, psychology is most definitely a science and a very worthy one too.",

A lot of what I would like to look at would be ethically unsound and this makes it difficult to umbrella my understanding of psychology under 'real' science. However, from what I know, behavioural psychology is largely experimental and is indeed a valid science. It's just that to the laymen, brain processes are much harder to see than chemical reactions and the effects of gravity.\n\nI think most people are not familiar with the different branches of psychology and tend to group them under a single stereotypical framework - often coming from how the media has portrayed psychologists.\n\nYes, qualitative studies have less predictive power, but it is extremely useful for discovering and exploring uncharted territories. It is almost like how Darwin discovered evolution through the observation of finches - to be able to realise the existence of a phenomenon is extremely useful to all science, it's just that psychology sometimes takes a bit longer to pinpoint what we are looking at.\n\n\n>Science is broadly defined as the study of the natural world based on facts learned through experiments or controlled observation\n\nI sometimes hear arguments which proclaim that 'correlational' outcomes are not enough to validate psychology as a science. However, I believe those who make this claim do not have a sufficient understanding of correlation. A philosopher of science would tell you that 'everything is correlational unless you have explored the entirety of the cosmos'. Like all science, psychology is about discovering the truth of the world... but also like all science, we can not prove the truth is 'true'. We can continue to develop working theories to explain the realities of the universe but the potential for deniability is always there.\n\n>Is ‚Äòcommon sense‚Äô science of value?\n\nA social psychologist might tell you that there is no such thing as 'common' sense because of the cultural/social and situational factors that must contribute to something being 'common'.

      "text": "We need to define our terms of what we mean by \"science.\"  These days, many scientists subscribe to what philosophers of science refer to as the \"Popperian\" approach to the scientific method: it is valid if the study is *falsifiable,* meaning there is a way to reject the null hypothesis.  \n\nA falsifiability criterion suggests a need for the study to also be reproducible, since you cannot meaningfully falsify a claim unless you can reproduce it.  (please note that some might argue that from a formal philosophical perspective, falsifiability and reproducibility are two independent criterions, but my position is that at least for the purposes of this discussion we are not concerned with what might hypothetically be the type of falsifiable phenomenon we could study, but what type of phenomenon we do study in an actionable way). \n\nOne of psychology's greatest struggles is its [difficulty in reproducing its results](http://www.nature.com/news/first-results-from-psychology-s-largest-reproducibility-test-1.17433).  This isn't to say that the field of psychology categorically \"isn't a science\" (although to be fair, one could argue that medicine overall isn't a science either; it is a profession based on scientific results), but it does affect its power (as in its sensitivity, or 1 ‚àí Œ≤).  \n\nOn an ethical level, it's worth asking whether, given its limitations, psychology is any more or less harmful to people than the effects of other 'sciences.'  I reject the human-neutral position that science is just a way of investigating questions.  It is conducted by and in the service of humans; there are plenty of \"scientific\" investigations -- human cloning, vivisection, etc -- that are of questionable value to capital S *Science* overall.  \n\nI highly recommend having a look at this [exchange of letters](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2011/aug/18/illusions-psychiatry-exchange/) a few years ago between prominent psychologists and psychiatrists about the current state of psychiatry (it is all in response to a controversial article published in the same magazine).  It is interesting reading what they say about their own field of study.  It is especially interesting to read the president of the APA's frank admission that we don't fully understand how psychotropic medications work, but that's OK if we are able to help patients with them. \n\nMy greatest concern about the science of psychology is the classic \"[reification fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reification_\\(fallacy\\))\" that diagnoses are often made on signs and symptoms alone, but then treated -- emotionally, behaviorally, cognitively, and/or pharmacologically -- as if an actual entity inside the person has been elucidated, when in reality that diagnosis is often an abstract definition used for the purposes of better understanding the relationship between a patient and a condition, and rarely should be seen as making an ontological claim about the mind-brain connection.  \n\nedit: to clarify about what I mean by the lack of reproducibility affecting power for readers who are not involved in research: Statistical power is affected by the sample size.  if your phenomenon has only been observed in a small sample size because your study cannot be reproduced, then the power of rejecting the null hypothesis is low, meaning there is a higher likelihood that the results you observed were due to chance, rather than the independent variable.",

I don't actually think it has no value whatsoever, but if you consider a cost/benefit function, functional imaging is hugely expensive in terms of dollars and expertise and yields data of questionably utility, whereas behavioral experiments are cheap cheap cheap and -- most of the time -- give us more useful data.\n\nI agree it would be very nice to merge psychology and biology perfectly and have detailed mechanistic explanations for all behaviors. But we are so far away from that right now and I don't know that continuing to dump funding into functional imaging at the expense of behavioral studies is a good idea (and it is always one experiment at the expense of the others -- and really, it is one fMRI experiment at the expense of maybe a dozen behavioral experiments, given the cost disparity).\n\nTake, for instance, drug addiction. We have an excellent understanding of what drugs like methamphetamine and cocaine do to the brain. We know that people who use these drugs have dysfunctional dopamine transmission that can be attributed largely to  downregulation of D2/D3 dopamine receptors in the striatum, leading to prefrontal dysregulation through a corticostriatal reciprocal circuit. We know how methamphetamine affects neurotransmitter transport proteins and transcription factors all over the brain. This is an oversimplification that uses a lot of big words to illustrate a point -- we have tons of information about what these drugs do to the brain. And this has produced ZERO effective treatments for methamphetamine and cocaine dependence. Instead, psychologists have produced treatments like [contingency management](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contingency_management) that actually help people stop using drugs sometimes.\n\nSo, fundamentally, I agree with you -- it would be great to merge psychology and biology and be able to identify the biological substrates of behavior. But while we still have people committing suicide, dying of drug addiction, and otherwise exercising maladaptive behaviors, I think our focus should be on adapting those behaviors, not identifying every molecule in every signaling cascade that's associated with them.",

I don't want to discuss the validity of Freud's (or his pupils) theroies, I want to point out a different (historical) fact:\n \nWhat you need to understand about Freud, is that what Freud did during the early 20th century was quite a revolution. He **TALKED** to patients! Men and **even women**! He talked about sex. All these things were taboo in the mainstream.

Regardless, lets take the reproducibility/effect size concept and apply it to what I study currently, factors that impact daily sleep quality in individuals without pathology. Based on theory, historical findings, and some basic science, I expect daily stress to be the best predictor of sleep quality in my samples. I typically find \"strong\" associations between these variables, and the effect has been reproduced numerous times across a variety of samples and measurement approaches. Cool.\n\nIf I want to start looking at other variables, say a possible moderator that changes the relationship between stress and sleep quality, I typically expect to find a much smaller association between my moderator and DV because my specific moderator is competing with lots of other influences that determine how susceptible a person is to stress related sleep disruption. I would be fine with a \"small\" correlation in this context, and my expectations adjust accordingly. If I find that an increased tendency to engage in repetitive, negative thinking patterns such as worry and rumination exacerbates the impact stress has on sleep quality, that is useful both theoretically and practically, as I've now identified an intervention target (even if it's minor, which was my expectation going in since these phenomenon are multiply determined and ultimately, very complex). Why is this inappropriate? Why shouldn't I use statistics to examine these types of phenomenon? \n\nAdditionally, many of the biologists and geneticists I know (for some reason a weird number), would argue that they have a terrible time controlling confounds, manipulating variables, and replicating studies. Even in your simple gravity experiment, yes, the items would reliably fall, but if you're measuring close enough and not operating in a complete vacuum, you're going to have a hell of a time reproducing your exact results and controlling for confounds, especially as you start measuring phenomenon that occur in more complex settings and conditions. Everything from surface friction with air, to variability in humidity, maybe even things like length of wire your signal needs to travel in order to engage two separate drop mechanisms... you're sure they're equal? Positive they're starting at the same height? How certain are you that you can adequately describe the impact your items shapes have on fall rate? How close and from what direction is the moon exerting gravitational influence currently? Maybe those are small things, but context is important in determining when you can allow for error and when you can't.  \n\nI could design a dropped weight equivalent for the sleep field, and the behavior would probably be just as predictable. Perhaps a sleep experiment in which I examine the near perfect hypothesized relationship between wake/sleep status and a 150 decibel megaphone announcement to my participant that \"I'm officially doing science, you may go back to sleep.\" Very little actual science is occurring in situations as refined as you suggest. Just ask a biologist or physicist.",

      "text": "Actually that's not true at all, I would like to hear from OP if that's what he meant. The word gravitation or gravity, by itself, usually implies gravitational force. And the force is certainly different only dependent on mass of both objects (unless new things have came out over classical mechanics) and their distance. \n\nEven if we talk about acceleration, the only reason they fall at the same speed is because their weight is so negligible that their pull onto the earth is literally non-measurable. If the ball was huge enough, it would pull earth towards it at a measurable acceleration and the time it takes to impact earth would be shorter than feather, given that everything else is controlled (which is not probable) without other stronger influence messing things up. \n\nI know this is going into the details a little too much for the \"original\" topic, but I see it as a horrible analogy if that's what the OP meant. Because \"something obvious doesn't mean it's true\" is certainly an objective fact, and has been proven again and again in the field of science. However \"Obviously, gravity has a greater effect on more massive objects than less massive objects... except it doesn't.\" has no merit of the same line of thinking. Gravity has a greater magnitude on more massive objects IS a fact, whether it can be enough to make a difference is a different topic. \n\nQuick edit: Unless you are talking strictly about gravitational field, then that's like saying everything is stationary because you use that thing as reference. It's just not a good analogy in my eyes, maybe I'm being picky.",

I usually even go to them even before statisticians when I need advice on a complicated study design (and corresponding stats tests).\n\nHowever, there's also a (fairly valid) critique is that the scientific community has a little too much of an obsession with p-values. Even knowledgable scientists -- at times, myself included -- get caught up in the \"statistically significant\" game that we lose sight of what it really means... and perhaps less arbitrary analyses like effect size and power.",

That's a pretty remarkable sophistication in terms of explaining and even PREDICTING specific behaviors!\n\nWhat about the supermodel priming study? If you prime people with multiple pictures of supermodels or scientists, they perform better/worse on tests of knowledge and skill, but if you prime them with a single picture of Einstein they do worse and if you prime them with a single picture of Claudia Schiffer they do better.

That's about a third of a hairdryer.\n\nWorse, because it concentrates in such a tiny organ, compared to your body weight, the _effective_ dose is that much more amplified - the dose to your thyroid from 1 g of I-131 is the same as if your whole body was getting almost 35 kW of energy delivered to it from a similar source.  Essentially, your thyroid would get cooked pretty quick with just 1g of material.\n\nOn the flip side, K-40 is almost entirely harmless; at 0.055 ¬µW/g, it's actually orders of magnitude lower energy, per gram, than the heat transfer _from_ you that results from enjoying a cool breeze (around 50-150 W).\n\nSr-90 emits ~2.5 W/g - which isn't really much.  Moreover, it's biological half-life is arguably shorter than its radiological half-life (it's been reported as little as 14 days and as much as 49 years, with a rough consensus on 18 years).  However, because it does concentrate in an organ that is both sensitive (bones and marrow), and because it's a high-energy double-emitter* (meaning it has a higher probability of its radiation causing chemical change), it's concerning to radbio experts.\n\nWhile its lifetime added cancer risk factor (according to the EPA) is about 0.185%/Bq for food ingestion - about half that of I-131 - to my knowledge, no cases of bone cancer in humans have been linked to Sr-90 exposure (while a LOT of papillary carcinoma has been linked to I-131).  It _has_ been shown to cause bone cancers and leukemia in animals at high doses, by which this risk was regressed for lower doses - a methodology that has come into question in recent times as more conservative than is warranted.\n\nAlso, keep in mind, while a Bequerel is a Bequerel, it doesn't always represent the same _mass_ of material.  1 TBq of I-131 is only about 225 ¬µg, while 1 TBq of Sr-90 is about 180 mg - almost 3 orders of magnitude more stuff.  So any given release of radionucleides is likely to contain about 1/800th the activity of I-131 in Sr-90.\n\n-----\n\n\\* By which I mean, Sr-90 decays to Y-90, which decays again before becoming sable Zr-90.\n\n[Edit: in my 2am fog, I neglected the exponents on the risk slope factors.

Don't M class dwarfs only give off infrared light, therefore inherently changing the way life would have evolved to survive?\n\nM-dwarfs are the main focus right now for two majors reasons:\n\n1.  They're the easiest to detect planets around.  In the two major techniques, both the transit method and the radial velocity (or Doppler or wobble) method, habitable zone, Earth-mass planets can be detected with today's technology, at least for the lowest mass M-dwarfs.  Since astronomers really want to find life as soon as possible, a lot of focus is on these stars where we might be able to find something *now*.\n\n2.  M-dwarfs are the most common star in the universe. Approximately 70% of stars are M-dwarfs, so if we can figure out how common planets are around M-dwarfs, we can get a good estimate for the entire galaxy (outside the center, at least).\n\n> Why is transit time such an issue when a planet orbiting an M class dwarf star would be significantly closer than we are to the sun to be considered \"habitable\"?\n\nI don't quite understand your question. The transit times tells us the period of the star, but changes in the period can tell us the mass of the planets in the system in some cases, since the changes in period indicate gravitational interactions between the planets that gives us information on their masses.\n\n> What is your favorite exoplanet that has been discovered on your hunt?\n\nWell, speaking for myself, I like the planet I'm the first-author on (the fluffy planet in the OP) just because I've always wanted to discover a planet.  Outside of that, I would say this [dissolving, Mercury-sized planet](http://www.nasa.gov/content/disintegrating-super-mercury-size-planet) that is literally boiling away because it's so close to its host star.\n\n-- Joey",

Don't M class dwarfs only give off infrared light, therefore inherently changing the way life would have evolved to survive?\n\nM-dwarfs are the main focus right now for two majors reasons:\n\n1.  They're the easiest to detect planets around.  In the two major techniques, both the transit method and the radial velocity (or Doppler or wobble) method, habitable zone, Earth-mass planets can be detected with today's technology, at least for the lowest mass M-dwarfs.  Since astronomers really want to find life as soon as possible, a lot of focus is on these stars where we might be able to find something *now*.\n\n2.  M-dwarfs are the most common star in the universe. Approximately 70% of stars are M-dwarfs, so if we can figure out how common planets are around M-dwarfs, we can get a good estimate for the entire galaxy (outside the center, at least).\n\n> Why is transit time such an issue when a planet orbiting an M class dwarf star would be significantly closer than we are to the sun to be considered \"habitable\"?\n\nI don't quite understand your question. The transit times tells us the period of the star, but changes in the period can tell us the mass of the planets in the system in some cases, since the changes in period indicate gravitational interactions between the planets that gives us information on their masses.\n\n> What is your favorite exoplanet that has been discovered on your hunt?\n\nWell, speaking for myself, I like the planet I'm the first-author on (the fluffy planet in the OP) just because I've always wanted to discover a planet.  Outside of that, I would say this [dissolving, Mercury-sized planet](http://www.nasa.gov/content/disintegrating-super-mercury-size-planet) that is literally boiling away because it's so close to its host star.\n\n-- Joey",

From that we can math out the size and orbital period (and from that, the distance) of a planet - those are the only two pieces of information that the wobble method can give us. Anything beyond this is either extrapolation or informed speculation.\n\nThe transit method gives us a lot more information. We can tell what percentage of a star's disc is being occulted by the 'dip' in the amount of light received from it, and from that we can estimate the planet's diameter. When we observe three dimming events with the same time difference (which is the standard for announcing a 'confirmed' exoplanet using the transit method), we know the planet's year, which also tells us its distance from the star. Most importantly, we can see exactly which wavelengths are being occulted and in what proportions, and thanks to spectroscopy, we can know what elements are in the atmosphere of the planet.\n\nIf we can combine the two methods, and add the planet's mass to the transit data, that plus the diameter also gives us the planet's density, which gives us strong clues about what it's made out of.\n\nAs for directly imaging exoplanets, [I'll leave this link with you](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_directly_imaged_exoplanets).",

      "text": ">The vast majority of stars in our galaxy are in binary star systems. Are most exoplanets you've detected in these systems or do they orbit single stars? \n\nMost planets are detected around single stars because of two reasons. First, single stars are the focus of planet search since the solar system is a single star system. Second, there are difficulties in detecting planets in binary stars. For example, in transit method, the signal from a planet will be diluted in a binary star system. It is like it is easier to see a mop flying across a lamp, but it is getting more difficult if there are more lamps shining on you. That being said, we did found many planets in binary stars, but the fraction is small compared to the fraction of binary stars among all stars. \n\n> How does planet hunters deal with binary systems or do you focus exclusively on either P-type or S-type orbits? \n\nFrom the Kepler data, it is difficult to know a star we are looking at is a binary star or a single star because Kepler does not provide enough resolution to resolve binary stars. We rely on follow-up observations to determine whether a detected planet is around a single star or a binary star. Therefore, the planet survey does not focus on either P-type or S-type orbits. We know it as an after effect. \n\nJi Wang",

      "text": "Direct imaging of exoplanets is possible but incredibly difficult unless the planet is quite large. In Washington DC, USA there is a scale solar model which shows the Sun and the planets at 1:10 Billion scale of their actual distances and sizes. The distance on that scale model is 4 cm from the Earth to the moon. The distance from the Sun to Pluto is 600m. If you could extend the model and visit the next nearest star, you would have to walk all the way to the California, USA. \n\nOne common method is the transit method which is what NASA's Kepler mission is using. Essentially, changes in the brightness of a star are measured. A decrease in brightness may be a clue that a planet is passing in front of its star (an eclipse from our point of view). There are limitations to this. The planet's orbit must pass in such a way that from our perspective here on Earth, it should be head - on and direct in such a way that we will be able to detect the eclipse. Preferably the planet's orbital period should be short so that we can view and observe each eclipse to confirm that a planet is indeed responsible. Now this is problematic if a planet has a very long orbital period. It might take decades or centuries before we are at the right time and place to see one happening.  \n\nAnother second common method is the Doppler method. All objects with mass exert gravitational forces. So a planet will exert some gravitational pull on their stars. This makes the stars \"wobble\". Other solar systems have their own center of gravity. If there is just one star, the center of gravity is usually around the star's general area. Due to the effect of other objects like planets, the stars are not static. They will revolve around the center of gravity of the whole system. Changes in velocity (velocity is speed and direction) by the star and the changes in the length of the wavelengths from the star's light as it is moving relatively towards and away from us are what we use to find out if a planet is involved.  \n\nA third method is the astrometric method. It is similar to the Doppler method except the wobble of the star is detected spatially. The wobble is usually tiny and given how far away we are, it is incredibly difficult, so it is not widely used to detect exoplanets. But it may help us learn more about the ones discovered.\n\nThere are more methods and this list is not exhaustive. They are not commonly used or are too difficult to use. Others include gravitational microlensing, which takes advantage of the properties of bending light around massive objects like stars. Another is the timing method which looks at radio waves from pulsars for clues of exoplanets orbiting them.",

Some of them have no idea about the situation at all, so their answers to questions like \"do you think a single ride fare of X would be acceptable\" or \"are you satisfied with the current pricing scheme\" will be meaningless in the best case, misleading at worst.\n\nIt's obvious that before any questions on the subject are asked, one must establish the relation of the respondent to the issue at hand: are they a public transport user? How regularly do they use it, and for what? And so on.\n\nIn fact, even if you sample (which in practice you inevitably do in cases like that), you have to address such matters.

You could get heavy users' replies of \"between 1 and 2 pounds\" mixed with some bankers, who never actually set foot in the tube, but still can say with confidence that \"50 quid sounds reasonable\".\n\nSame happens in the Ice Cream Conundrum case.

So what you want to do is estimate the probability that people in each neighborhood prefer chocolate, rather than a single probability for the population. Having more people from each neighborhood to estimate these probabilities is never a bad thing; analyzing your data incorrectly by assuming something about the population that isn't true is.\n\nIn fact, what you really want to do is hierarchical modeling, where you use neighborhood assignments to jointly estimate the overall population preferences and individual neighborhood preferences. This still means that there will be one level where you're analyzing 7 units, but at another level you're analyzing the whole mass of people that you've sampled. But with this model, more data is always better, since it gives you more precise estimates of the quantities you care about (the neighborhood preferences around each parlor).\n\ntldr: Statistically, there's no problem with \"too large\" a sample size, just with model misspecification",

And you want to treat them with a drug?  And...you want to laser microdissect the tissue?\n\nSuddenly that a priori n=18 per treatment group is translating into YEARS of work for someone to get these precious samples.  Not to mention that each time you do this nightmare experiment, it all has to work perfectly.  And then you've talked yourself right back into the old \"n=3\" type of experiment.\n\nI know I've read papers with this type of reasoning published in very high-impact journals, often with only semi-quantitative analysis and they wind up having significant, lasting effects in my field.  It's time for PIs to stop designing projects like this, it's time for postdocs to stop agreeing to projects like this...and most importantly it's time for journals to stop publishing data like this.",

      "text": "Grant money biases experiments. If a scientist knows their chances of securing funding is predicated on conducting experiments which could potentially confirm the grantor's biases, they will run small sample sized experiments and consciously or unconsciously choose to publish studies with results that tend to confirm said biases. Failure to do so can result in lack of funding and the prospect of making little to no impact in their field. If the funding is secured because the scientist's smaller scale studies confirmed the grantor's biases, there will be even greater pressure for the scientist to engage in unethical behavior if they produce contradictory results, directly proportional to the cost and scale of the study. \n\nIt wouldn't be a problem if scientists were perfectly ethical robots, but they're flawed just like the rest of us. With the overemphasis on STEM careers and the already serious over supply of research scientists for the current level of funding that's available, the unfortunate reality is that‚Äîfaced with massive student loan debt, low salaries, and little private sector marketability‚Äîmany scientists will find it impossible not to let their biases and the biases of the grantors taint their work.",

      "text": "A big question! :) \n\nThere are decades of epidemiologic research on the associations of breastfeeding (duration, exclusivity, etc) and long-term outcomes. For a summary, see this Review from The Lancet: [Breastfeeding in the 21st century: epidemiology, mechanisms, and lifelong effect](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(15)01024-7/abstract). But what drives these associations? Which components of milk? - this field of research is relatively newer, and is basically the core question that drives my research group!\n\nTaking the microbiome as an example - there is plenty of data showing the short-term importance of breastfeeding as the key driver of microbiome development. But long term? Harder to say, since we have only been studying this for \\~10 years. But we are working on it! For example, the babies we studied in the CHILD Cohort are now 16 years old, so we will be looking again at their microbiomes to see if any 'signature' remains in their microbiomes or immune systems based on their infant feeding experiences (and potential their milk composition!)\n\nMilk-derived (or inspired) HMOs, nanovesicles and immune proteins are indeed being studies for therapeutic use. I find this super interesting! For example, maybe HMOs (which shape the infant microbiome) could help fix gut microbiome disruptions in adults with conditions like Chron's or IBD. Maybe milk-derived antibodies could be used to help prevent infections in vulnerable populations. Maybe milk-inspired nanovesicles could be adapted to help orally deliver drug compounds. These are all being researched currently! Exciting times ahead!",

      "text": "The points you addressed here are a part of a broader, very socially complex challenge in public understanding of this area of science.\n\nYour question assumes that these studies definitively disprove long-term effects of breastfeeding, which they do not. This is a very difficult thing to do, as long term development is influenced by a complex myriad of variables. My colleagues who specialize in some of the outcomes you mentioned, and their mechanisms of action, will chime in on some of the specifics.\n\nI [addressed Colen and Ramey's 2014 sibling study](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1meqv9w/comment/n6eumwv/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) elsewhere. As with any field, there is the occassional news article about a study that \"caused scientist to go back to the drawing board!\" Usually it is sensational. The reality is always more nuanced.\n\nIn general, sure--with good controls, some of the effects do decrease. But the media gives the impression that these studies have completely called the entire field into question. That does not reflect a consensus in our field. We debate many things, but whether or not the optimal way to feed a mammalian infant is the milk of its own species is not one of them.\n\nAs with any area of health research, we are working on establishing more consistent standards that help us more accurately measure both breastfeeding itself, and the outcomes. In our lab, where we do large scale prospective cohort studies, we spend a *ton* of time talking about exactly this. And when we do our analyses with these standards, in many cases yes, we have found that there is still an effect. But what our improved methodology also does, is show us more interesting nuanced dynamics happening within the data. It doesn't \"negate\" breastfeeding--*it makes it more interesting.*\n\nIt's important to understand what randomization and controls tell us, and what they don't. Breastfeeding is not mere food. It is a complex, living system of nutrition, immunity, and developmental programming. It is not just a behavior but a *suite of behaviors* that co-evolved with infant sleep, social behavior, and parenting behavior. The lack of RCT on breastfeeding does not negate the entire field, because you can't test a complex system like a drug and expect to get the whole picture. RCTs are useful and informative‚Äìbut the broader literature, across all the fields that you see represented here today, gives us the context we need to interpret a given single study, and its broader implications.\n\nLactation is an adaptive strategy that defined an entire new taxonomic family and shaped its evolutionary trajectory in dramatic ways. Each mammal species makes milk that was shaped by its environment over millions of years. Evolutionary biologist Theodosius Dobzhansky‚Äôs observation that ‚Äúnothing in biology makes sense except in light of evolution‚Äù is profoundly relevant, here, and is why I chose anthropology as the lens through which I study this system. Formula is a nutritionally complete, life-saving invention that we are lucky to have, but breastfeeding is the evolutionary default, and everything we know about biology tells us that when you expose an animal to conditions too different from its evolved niche, you can expect pathology to arise, and this we have observed with the advent of formula. And since science only started caring about breastfeeding at all in the 60‚Äôs, we have barely begun to unravel the effects of this evolutionarily dramatic shift. If we want to test this complex system as an intervention, then we need to begin from the assumption that lactation constitutes the evolutionary default for human infants (and the mother, who is also an important part of this system), and formula is the intervention‚Äìthe evolutionarily novel condition. The burden of proof, therefore, is on formula‚Äìthe intervention‚Äìto prove its safety and effectiveness, and not on breastfeeding‚Äìthe evolved norm‚Äìto prove its safety and effectiveness.",

      "text": "The sibling study is one of two studies that have been widely misappropriated in the representation of lactation science. (The other being the PROBIT trial.) Alison Stuebe, a past president of the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine, [wrote about both of these studies on ABM's blog](https://bfmed.wordpress.com/2014/03/01/reports-on-breastfeeding-sibling-study-are-vastly-overstated/).  \n  \n**The tl;dr on the sibling study** is that it does have some value in telling us that breastfeeding is not a panacea (but that vibe originates mostly in the media, not scientists) but **the conclusions they draw aren‚Äôt warranted by the methodology,** particularly its overlooking of important outcomes, and contradicts a mountain of established research‚Äìas well as our broader understanding of lactation as a system‚Äìand overlooks some important outcomes.  \n  \nMethodologically, the grouping for the sibling study doesn‚Äôt really make much sense given what we know about breastfeeding. The outcomes associated with breastfeeding generally have an exposure-response effect (longer/more breastfeeding => bigger effects), which is why it doesn‚Äôt make sense that this study gave so much weight to kids who had any human milk at all, even if it was just one day. They also didn‚Äôt note the average duration measured, or whether the breastfed babies were exclusively breastfed or mixed-fed--which you‚Äôd think would be pretty relevant, wouldn‚Äôt you? This is a pretty serious omission, given that they had to have those data to run the tests.  \n  \nAlso, there doesn‚Äôt seem to be any sense to the outcomes selected by this study. Most notably, the study ignores some pretty important outcomes with well-established associations with breastfeeding for children under 4, such as infection, diarrhea, vomiting, and ear infections....Ear infections don‚Äôt seem like a big deal to most people here in the West, but timed badly they can contribute to speech delays. The authors admit that these limitations are a function of the available data, but without including all the relevant outcomes, it does not make sense to draw the dramatic conclusion that they did about their results. If this study was rejected from more important medical journals, this would be a big reason why, I think.¬†\n\nIt‚Äôs also important to note that the study does not in the least disprove a causative relationship between breastfeeding and the long-term outcomes they measured. If it had, that would be a huge deal and it would have been published in a higher impact journal. The conclusion that breastfeeding plays no role at all in the measured outcomes just isn‚Äôt consistent with what we see in cultures where breastfeeding is more culturally normalized and not stratified across SES. For example, in a [large-scale, longitudinal, prospective study in Brazil](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(15)70002-1/fulltext) and published in The Lancet, which controlled for SES (and also, notably, measured breastfeeding duration rather than merely breastfed/not breastfed), found a positive relationship between breastfeeding and IQ, educational attainment, and adult income.\n\nThere are other issues with this study, but I‚Äôm trying to be ‚Äúbrief‚Äù with a very complex topic. Additional important context, here, is that a sibling comparison is not a perfect substitute for controlling for SES, because incomes change as families grow. But also, as any experienced parent will tell you, parenting experiences with subsequent children can be different. With breastfeeding, many people struggle with their first baby but succeed more with subsequent babies. Also, parenting strategies improve with experience. And furthermore, individual parental and child temperaments interact with each other and influence each other, and every child/parent dynamic is different‚Äìthat is to say, not every child is parented the same way, even within families. \n\nNotably, the sibling study authors gave in their concluding paragraph to changing the social systems that constitute major barriers to breastfeeding. This section has been given very little attention in the media coverage of this study.",

      "text": "Well, lets see the last time the Greek civilization collapsed we lost calculus and didn't find it again for another 1500 years.\n\nOne can only wonder what got lost in the shuffle, but we have billionaires ready to pitch the end of the world as a wild growth opportunity with 10-15% growth year over year for the next 100 years, so long as we're looking at Q1 after the end of whatever caused civilization to collapse.\n\nLastly, Mr. Kemp was peculiar about the civilizations he chose to examine.\n\n* [√áatalh√∂y√ºk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%87atalh%C3%B6y%C3%BCk) - is a FASCINATING case in itself and the reason it \"recovered\" so well, was because it was quite likely the first city. So while Civilization could collapse it wasn't much of a fall - and might simply have been something where people abandoned the settlement if growing conditions were less than ideal. The city - able to house about 3-5 thousand people might be best thought of as the most well preserved small town/municipality we can identify as such. There are no fortifications , there are no battlements , barely any lithography suggesting strongly the city was built and occupied before even written language was a thing. \n\n* The Western Roman Empire , again might well be a good proxy - but here again - the fall was from centralized imperial control - which was already in decline from the height of the Roman Empire writ large and noting that the populations fared largely well. This again might well be due to the fact that it's largely France/Southeastern Germany, Spain that we're talking about - areas with excellent infrastructure and adequate development where the roads and bridges in many cases survive to this day and are useable two thousand years later. So again, the fall of the Empire was a fall from the rule of dynastic semi-representative governance/dictatorship and the big upside was that the local populations did not have to put into the imperial purse...They did have to suffer from a variety of troubles and did not re-develop the same level of civilizational complexity for nearly 500 years afterwards and the start of the pre-industrial age and the start of what we think of as the middle ages in 1250-1300 or so.\n\nIn this way - we have some major bias towards some pre-industrial societies and we do not look at examples in modern history such as the fall of Afghanistan , or the situation in areas where dictatorships fell apart in more modern times. It's critical to the argument of Mr. Kemp is making that we don't. \n\nLooking at post-Imperial Japan, it's not for years after the war that Japan can feed itself, the same is true in Korea for nearly 10 years after WW2 as well. Success was had because the United States and Japanese became close allies for fear that Japan might well fall to Soviet influenes. It's not helpful to look at places like Cuba after the fall of the supporting state of Russia stopped being able to provide. \n\nAn example that might prove useful as yet would be something like how many times Argentina has failed to coalesce into a regional super-power and the various mechanisms it has been subjected to in the effort to get out and away from it's three iterations of governance that it seems to fall into. \n\nTo be fair there are examples like South Korea or Post-Franco Spain that really are fascinating to look at and study. \n\nWorse, for the argument is that there are various kinds of collapse that could be considered, the loss of oil - perhaps permanently as a result of some terrorist act at say the Al-Ghawar mega-well, what might a world suddenly very constrained of a given resource look like.\n\nWhat might a civilization look like after a comet strike or in what has to be the real subject what might America look like in just a few short years.\n\nWe don't have a super-great reference for a major systems failure - although Covid certainly gave us a preview of what incompetence + actual danger could EASILY cause the extermination of the entire species - had Covid been say 50% fatal - as is the case with Bird Flu (H5N1) or some other diseases where mortality rates are non-trivial - it's possible that billions of people could have died.\n\nIn this way we don't think of our politics as being a factor in our survival - but we most definitely need to, as not every political system even feels responsible to \"the people\" as clearly was the case in the United States, where hyper-interest in individual well-being did not translate into effective public policy or group policies that worked effectively except against the will of some portion of the people who benefited.",

The taller and healthier people are *significantly* more likely to survive such a collapse, while the small and weak people become victims of violence or fall to disease. The decimated population, now consisting of tall and healthy people, spreads the wealth out less. \n\nNot only is the outcome far from good for the other 90% of people, but the good part does not last for long. The egalitarian societies are rapidly overtaken by stronger Kingships, which grow to become Tyrannies as the children of Kings become spoiled by wealth within a few generations.\n\nThe background research seems pretty solid from what I've read, but most of the conclusions being drawn are a stretch, at best. That said, I do agree that we are heading towards a societal collapse as the middle class diminishes, economic inequality is growing rapidly, and political polarization has been building for the past 50 years.\n\nThe goal should not be to stop 'the few' from amassing wealth by forcing economic equality. This stifles innovation, provokes dissent and violence in those who feel that they deserve more than they get, and rapidly leads to political violence that destabilizes the society further.\n\nThe goal should be to bolster the middle class, such that the vast majority of people within the society belong to it in a meaningful way. This allows the majority the wealth and security of land ownership, and it naturally reduces political polarization as people have less of a reason to focus on politics outside of election periods. This, in turn, reduces instances of plain corruption in government, slowing the approach of the collapse.\n\nThe collapse itself is inevitable, but it can be slowed. What comes *immediately* after may be better for those few who survive it, but their grandchildren consistently lost their freedom and suffered under Tyrants. A balanced system preserves freedom *much* more effectively by slowing systemic corruption, while allowing for a strong state that is capable of supporting much larger population sizes.",

      "text": "Edit - sorry for the essay. I think you definitely pushed one of my buttons üòÇ, but hopefully my reply will be useful to you. \n\nYup. Well worth looking up the ‚Äúlazy bed‚Äù method. Potatoes are a complete food - you won‚Äôt be excited, but you won‚Äôt die.  \n\n\nSo I‚Äôve been studying gardening and survivalism for decades at this point. And the people above have got completely the wrong end of the stick. You absolutely would not be farming hooved ungulates unless you know what you‚Äôre doing. No live stock.  Can you cut a sheep‚Äôs throat and then disembowel it ? Can you cure bloat ? Sheep scab ? Listeriosis ? Do you know how to souse and cure pork ? Nah. Stick to birds. \n\nAn orchard ? Of what ?! Our local Italians here who came out after the World War II practice an amazing form of traditional gardening where you have everything growing together in one place. They plant vegetables between the rows of grape vines. And fruit trees at the end of the rows, and then the chickens scratch around under the whole thing. So just the fact that the people above seem to think that you need a pasture *as well as* an orchard shows me that they haven‚Äôt really thought this through, or done any research as to how people actually do this kind of thing in real life. The orchard *is* the pasture. Its also the veggie garden, and the chicken coop. \n\nI‚Äôve also very successfully experimented with straw bale gardening, which is probably the best way for newbies and people with cold winters to grow serious food crops. It‚Äôs how we used to mass produce food before the invention of poly tunnels ‚Äì and it‚Äôs incredibly effective and doesn‚Äôt need much input.\n\nSo straw bales as a side production of wheat production, and then it needs a strong urea application to get the composting going. But I mean, that‚Äôs chicken poo, so easy to get a hold of.\n\nIn this kind of situation you don‚Äôt recreate a ‚Äúmodel farm.‚Äù If you look at some of the principles of Permaculture, it‚Äôs really helpful because they go through what in modern home gardening is based on modern agricultural techniques. So the whole idea that you should plant plants in rows to make it easier to mechanically harvest. In Permaculture, you plant your plants on a hexagonal grid because you can get more plants to the space doing it that way. \n\nOne of the best ways to set up a food supply is to create a chicken based system, using them as tractors to prepare the ground for you. You then plant in the place that they‚Äôve just cleared for you. Some people make a system of domes using the old pvc pipe trick, and some people make a central chookhouse, with runs opening out into different fenced gardens. \n\nIt‚Äôs worth looking for the old hippy magazines like Earth Garden, and reading the works of the Permaculturists, because these are the people who have been working on these kinds of issues since the 1960s. I mean David Holmgren is really worth following up because he‚Äôs written an entire book on how to implement Permaculture principles into suburbia.\n\nIt‚Äôs really easy to reinvent the wheel here, but when you look to the people who have already been doing this for the last 60 years, you can stand on the shoulders of giants instead of speculating using your own knowledge about what‚Äôs possible and what isn‚Äôt. People have been actively working on the solutions to this issue for a long time. It‚Äôs just that they‚Äôre dismissed as ‚Äúhippies‚Äù, which they are, but they also know a shitload about creating a sustainable food supply.",

You are establishing yourself as an adult, starting a career, starting a family‚Ä¶ making the decisions that will set conditions for your family life, financial future, and so on. If you‚Äôre not inheriting wealth, it is very hard to replace the opportunity cost of not investing during these years, of not building a path to what for many will be their peak earning years later in life. \n\nTrying to find a balance that allows for purpose, fulfillment, meaning, or whatever else floats your boat is certainly important. Finding yourself? That‚Äôs what the first 20 years were for. Especially if you grew up in a developed nation and family environment with conditions to care for you and nurture you into adulthood with minimal responsibility.",

In his late 30's early 40's  he had some rich friend that got him a gig doing guided tours.  like basically high paid glamping sherpa type work.    where extremely wealthy people would helicopter in to some boogie as fuck outdoor adventure.       last time i was in nyc  this dude had married this wealthy wall street burn out woman,  and they had an apt in williamsburg and land upstate.  and he did like maybe 6 of these guided adventures a year.   each time he earned insane money.    \n\n  \nmuch more mundane.  i have a really good friend,  his wife,  was a rave girl,  kinda misc joe job type person,  did the cliche coding bootcamp.  got her shit together in her 30's   now has a solid career.  \n\nI have another good friend.  she was a 90's  \"club kid\"  in early 90s nyc.   got in as a legal secretary  in her late 20's early 30's    traded her last  youthful burst to get in with a more prestigious joe job,   that had a decent upper ceiling for pay.      she's in her late 40s early 50's now.   And makes solid money.  \n\nthe problem is.    as always your economic proximity.   and mobility.       IF you have the ability to upskill or relative safety to go to school/acquire skills that translate into a career that can pay well...\n\n  \ndoesn't at all matter what you did prior to that.        \n\n  \nand.  a supportive partner,   or   lil mommy and daddy money/leg up.   and you're off to the races.  \n\n  \nthe people who fuck around and stay fucked,  are those that just languish in non-paying jobs.",

I was in decent shape when I hiked a couple of volcanoes in Guatemala, and it still kicked my ass. That‚Äôs an experience I would‚Äôve robbed myself of had I waited until retirement. (For reference, there wasn‚Äôt a single person over 45 on that trek.)\n\nI both agree and disagree with the notion that one shouldn‚Äôt ‚Äútake two years off to find themselves.‚Äù I agree that someone shouldn‚Äôt just drop everything and head to Thailand with no plan, no prospects, and no income.\n\nHowever, if you‚Äôre given a productive opportunity to do something like that, you should take it. I left a great role to serve in the Peace Corps and spent nearly three years in Guatemala. It had its ups and downs, but I walked away with almost $8,000 post-tax in a lump sum after my service.\n\nMore importantly, it was a meaningful experience that fostered personal growth and gave me a new perspective on the world ‚Äî and it led to even greater opportunities down the line.\n\nNow, I‚Äôm in graduate school. While I‚Äôve had issues with funding due to the current administration cutting my fellowship, my school has stepped in and is actively working with me to find solutions. They awarded me a scholarship to study a foreign language this summer, and now I‚Äôm headed to Brazil to study Portuguese. My plan is to apply for both the Boren and Fulbright fellowships so I can continue studying the language next year.\n\nIt‚Äôs also worth noting: I‚Äôd honestly prefer someone from my hometown to do the complete opposite of what the original post suggests. Most people I grew up with are married with a gaggle of kids by 25, divorced with kids, addicted to substances, or some combination of the above ‚Äî and many just never leave.",

This is what life is supposed to be. Insisting that there is some \"line\" that, if you don't have it all figured out by then, you are sunk, is a terrible thing to put on someone. So if you are over 30 and you don't have it in the bag you are nowhere? I doubt you are much beyond 30. You NEVER figure it all out. Never. Its not about \"figuring\" anything. Life isn't a statistics problem. Its an experience and you should have as many experiences as you can. I took life FAR too seriously in my 20s, and if i have a regret, its that one. I thought YOUR way was the right way. And I wasted some time. I would have been far better off learning to enjoy life, having relationships, trying things out. You can't pour yourself into a mold and force yourself into something. I mean, you CAN but it doesn't bring happiness. \n\nSo yeah, anybody reading this who is past 30 who hasn't made it and is now feeling shitty because there is no hope, i am proof you can disregard this terrible advice lol",

Took my career seriously out the gate. I do indeed have some fun but I have personal reasons for jumping straight and hard into my career (potentially uncertain lifespan and my take is to save for my families future now rather than risk not having the ability to later).\n\nHaving invested pretty simply (total market funds, no bonds, no cash, no crypto, no individual stocks, etc), I've now realized running numbers that I am on pace to have enough to retire in my 40's. Will I do that? Likely not. But instead, I get to ramp down my savings and basically up my lifestyle with 0 concern. We make a combined income of \\~$165k/yr as a family but we just bought a new house despite rates being terrible, renovated it to our desire, we go on great vacations, we send our child to private school, still max our retirement accounts...all while having basically no concerns, fears or financial burdens. I have no fear of getting fired. If I am treated poorly, I would feel extremely comfortable walking away. Having money provides control ***and*** safety.\n\nHaving no financial stress about either now ***or*** your future is hard to describe. It is quite freeing. I now get to choose what I want to do for the rest of my life instead of only choosing what to do in my 20's. Compounding interest is powerful, but you really can't see the results within the first decade. I'm lucky to even be seeing it just after the first decade. Sure, great to have fun in your 20's for 10 years. But I'll be having fun in my 40's for 20, 30, 40(?) years. And I still had a little fun in my 20's too.\n\nThe issue isn't just that you lose 10 years of income and savings. It's things like the fact that you will be taken less seriously. It's so much easier to land a job at a big company straight out of college than it is at 32 with nothing great on your resume. It's so much harder to develop good financial and career related habits when you spent 10 years not doing it. Statistically, the people who start caring 10 years late are going to miss a lot more than those 10 years. They're now working uphill.\n\nThere is no right or wrong answer though. You have time, and you need to use it to \"buy\" the life you want. This is just what works for me and I feel optimizes my time alive. I mostly agree with OP. Thought 30 isn't too late at all. You're just making things harder than it needs to be. It also isn't a black vs. white. You can be \"very dark grey\" and get 90% of the perks of one option and 10% of the other.",

      "text": "Wow. That's wild.  Seems like the red flags you saw prior to the interview, grew more during the interview.  For what's it worth, I'm a career coach and have been a senior director in a high tech firm.  I think it was totally appropriate for you to walk out.  Best case, you graciously said--thank you so much for considering me, I don't feel this is a fit for me, all the best.  But, that etiquette is for your sake.  You're really not obligated, unless you foresee the possibility of it coming back to bite you.  Hard to know in the moment, so unless in danger of physical harm, best to bow out of any situation like this, gracefully--for your sake.\n\nYou didn't share what their response was to you walking out.  Curious to know.\n\nWould you continue sitting at dinner with someone you just met who behaved in creepy ways and asked strange questions?  No, you'd politely excuse yourself.  \n\nThe same rules of decency, resonance, value alignment, apply in all situations.  I know it feels tempting to disregard these at work, but if you think about it, I'm sure you'll agree, this is where you spend the majority of your waking hours and very likely the area of your life where you are growing and developing the most.\n\nI so get your thought about perhaps helping them turn things around, improve...That used to be me.  Here's where I land on this now.  That'll never work, it will make me miserable, and when they fall or fail, I will go down with them.  No thank you.  I'm not here to save a company, a culture, a leader or anyone.  I'm here to contribute to something I believe in and can be proud of.  If I can't say those things about it, I'm not applying.  It WILL BE A NIGHTMARE, guaranteed.  If you're someone like me who infuses a lot of energy, joy and intelligence in environments, find a company that really values those qualities and don't stop until you get in!  \n  \nIf the company is stating directly or indirectly, but certainly clear that they need help in a certain area, that they've not created yet what they want and are looking for experts to help them grow...go for it.\n\nIf it's you believing that bringing your integrity and energy will change things--remember this, you didn't come here to fix other people's problems (again, unless they've asked for help) and when we do this, we end up drained, disappointed and it deeply diminishes our self-esteem because we couldn't make the changes we knew were needed.\n\nFind a company with the kind of culture you really want to work in with other honest, smart, thoughtful people, in a role that excites you where you can make a contribution, but not have to save the place, and that pays a commensurate salary.  It's out there.  Play more with how to go about finding it and making the right connections and getting inside.\n\nGood luck!",

I got a call from the owner of one of our clients asking me to \"Delete all their backups from our servers and from local storage\" I flat out refused. \"I can't do that without approval from my manager. I understand it's your data and I will happily provide you copies of it. But I can't delete it without my manager approving that\" He got quite upset and hung up.\n\nI got off the phone, walked into my managers office and started explaining the conversation. While I was still in the office about 30 RCMP officers walked into our office with bankers boxes and carts. They were there to take our servers to prevent data loss because this company was apparently under investigation for fraud dealing with the federal government. \n\nI had a nice long conversation with an RCMP officer about what was asked of me and why I refused, my answer to that was \"This exact conversation is why I refused to delete it...\" Thankfully my bosses reasoned with the officers and convinced them to allow us to export all that client's backups from our servers so we could keep the servers. They were intending to just take all the hardware which would have crippled us. \n\nSo yeah. Don't do illegal shit, and if something feels like it might be fishy, it probably is.",

My wife had just been through such a conflict, which caused us to be looking for these new jobs in the first place. I described, in general, what had happened and how we'd come to the decision we had. I got the job offer.\n\nSome years later, he asked me to take a short-term assignment outside of corporate HQ, which after checking with my family, I agreed to. While I was gone, a huge problem emerged and gained a great deal of bad publicity - not in my area, but one affecting my (internal) clients, all of which got fired right up to the CEO. Once the dust settled, I got invited back to HQ and had a relatively calm rest of my time there.",

The people who thought it was unprofessional of me to walk out weren't quite boomers, but they were the only people at work who are older than me.\n\nIt's the first time I've walked out of an interview, but the second time I have wanted to, with the first time being somewhat similar to yours with the employer making a point about how I wasn't qualified.\n\nFor that one, I walked into an office that was completely silent and untidy, with everybody looking extremely miserable. I then interviewed with the MD who was delusional and senile. The job description didn't match the actual role at all and he was making out that this was somehow my fault. He kept making a point about how I couldn't do 90% of the work as I hadn't done it before.\n\nThe only thing that stopped me from getting up and leaving was that he clearly wasn't all there (he was talking about adverts in his shop window that didn't exist and all of the customers inside when there were none) and I was concerned that my leaving may have had an impact on his mental health.\n\nBizarrely, I was invited to a second interview, which I declined. The person I spoke to over the phone didn't bother to ask why, but my suspicion is that I was far from the first call and that everybody else had declined a second interview as well.",

Now working in the federal side doing the same job. You could throw me in any DoD agency and I‚Äôd know the systems and policies to a tee. What I wouldn‚Äôt know though is the history, all the quarks, ins and outs or have the quick reaction to resolve a problem that required knowledge of past operations to be handled in a proficient and swift manner. All while upholding and maintaining the security of the information and assets I‚Äôm sworn to secure and protect in relation to how they integrate and move around to support our mission. \n\nDuring my last fours years active I worked alongside a  civil servant who was about to retire. For three years I absorbed every bit of knowledge he had and it still was enough to account for the 19 years he had in the agency. When he left it was just me in the office and the remaining with the 19 years of continuity. My time with him still wasn‚Äôt enough but, I was all that remained. As our office was only two deep. It was one of the key factors in the agency deciding to hire me into the position when I retired. His continuity and what I had absorbed were vital. \n\nSee at least for the DoD what a lot of people fail to realize is the civil servants work along side uniformed military. We frequently are required to move. Usually every 3-4 years and occasionally every year. Very rarely to we get somewhere and the person we are replacing is still there. It‚Äôs often those career civil servants, especially the higher level ones, we turn to because they aren‚Äôt required to move. \n\nNot because we don‚Äôt know how to do the job but because we need to have the continuity handover. It‚Äôs vital to mission effectiveness and execution. Without them it‚Äôs like a well built muscle car that hasn‚Äôt been maintained for years. It may still run but it‚Äôs nowhere near as fast, effective or safe to drive and it‚Äôs only a matter of time before it breaks down.",

You laugh while they dismantle all the checks and balances of democracy, cheering because you are ‚Äúowning the opposition‚Äù.

It is so boldly and disgustingly intentional, it‚Äôs astounding. They want to derail people‚Äôs whole life paths and force them to accept an alternative that falls within their agenda \n\nAnd I can‚Äôt imagine the absolute gut punch this is for the established researchers/career professionals that have already been affected. Some of the commenters here have already put this uniquely painful kind of loss that they‚Äôre experiencing into words.

I feel like that's ultimately what's popularizing most trad wife content, lately. Damn near everyone is burnt the fuck out, but only women have this supposed option to go trad and become stay at homers (let's be honest, though. Trad life isn't actually an option for most people. A lot of us are in a two income kind of economy and have been for at least 15 years now.) Whoever said she wanted to be a trophy wife was partially right. What she really wanted was to be a child with a parent taking care of her.\n\n\nRegardless, she needed to seriously get her shit together. Self assess, communicate, etc. They clearly had enough money for therapy, and she... well. She really needed it. No one who's doing well implodes their nice life like this. No one. Something's going on and she needed to take some damn initiative to address it. And not block OOP every time *he* tried to address it.",

You can get a decent house for ¬£250k outside of London. The actual liquid capital they walked away with should be more than sufficient if you don't have expensive tastes.\n\nI'd be really interested to hear what she sounds like, as her aspirations to being wealthily idle somewhat depend on how she presents herself, where her family come from, and who they know. It wouldn't be impossible with the right social circle and I've seen it both work and fail from within the community of parents when I was at Private School. A couple of years working for Daddy's business before being matched with an appropriate divorcee looking for a partner to holiday with. Or she could spend the next twenty years waiting in the corners of bars unsuccessfully. To paraphrase Withnail, help is freely given to those who can afford it, but it's very expensive to those who can't.\n\nIf I had to guess though from just what's written, she has somewhat lost touch with reality.  The sort of support you need to maintain such standards of living without a job is not available to many, and the courts won't take aspirations into account either. Her quitting her job of ¬£50k, buying a bigger house and car than they can afford, and insisting on staying home without kids? The Judge is going to tell her she should get her job back to support herself. NHS pensions are really good, she gets deposit money from the shared property, so she's even theoretically covered for old age and living arrangements until then.\n\nWith his half I'd recommend a move somewhere bucolic, and maybe keep a flat in the city for work. Get a small historic property that'll appreciate in the countryside, and join a social charitable organisation like the buffs (Royal Antediluvian Order of Buffaloes), and put a little spare time and money in. Drop five bags on a nice hard wearing suit that can as easily be worn into the woods as a nice restaurant, and go from there. A little society and humility, and in a decade he'd be sitting happily in the social position she aspired to.",

      "text": "Another \"fun fact\" about the tradwife trend is that it is a lie. Those women *do* work. They are influencers. Then we can argue about whether being an influencer is work or not, but bottom line is this:\n\nIf a woman like oop's wife gives up her job and becomes a tradwife and lives the tradwife lifestyle for 10 years and then the husband leaves her she is now solidly fucked. She's got no income, she's got no stuff, she's got no place to live, she's got no job prospects. Essentially it's a one way ticket to a low income job and struggling to put food on the table. Even worse if they have kids she needs to provide for. If he goes to the court he can afford a good solicitor and either screw her in a custody battle or drag it out for so long she's fully out of funds and just needs to accept whatever arrangement he wants. These life prospects outside of her life with her husband may also lead to her accepting being treated like shit or abused cause at least she wouldn't be struggling for food or keeping a roof over her head.\n\nIf TikTok Tradwife‚Ñ¢Ô∏è gets divorced she can go buy a house. Maybe it's smaller than she is used to and maybe she'll need a couple of her furniture pieces to be IKEA and not some kind of fancy designer, but she's not struggling to eat. If the divorce ruins her tiktok image she can pivot inside the same industry she has been in for years and either become a different kind of influencer or she can step over to the backend and work with other influencers managing their business. \n\nI can't believe we need to explain this to women in this day and age. Our grannies knew this. They knew exactly how vulnerable you are, how the power imbalance means you can end up in a really difficult spot and how bloody hard it can be. Our mums watched this and thought \"I'll be damned before it happens to me.\". Generations of women fought for the right to be equal in their own homes and in the world and won. Now young girls and apparently grown ass women are being seduced into thinking being dependent on a man (who could divorce her, cheat, become abusive or drop dead at any moment) by women who are **not** dependent on their husband.

He just doesn't want to work and his parents are enabling him at this point. By the way they describe him, he's the most awesome son ever, they make it sound like people should just kiss his feet or something, that's how \"special and incredibly resilient\" he is (he's not).   \nHe even had a girlfriend that left him because he was ambitionless, and to this day he and his family still talk ill about her, how she was not a real woman who cares for her boyfriend and helps him through his hard times: she did, oh she tried so hard to get him to study! He just didn't care. (I know another man who, with his girlfriend's help, finished university and is now looking for jobs, after being in a slump for years. Needless to say, their relationship is thriving. I'm convinced that if a person truly wants to get better, they will. If they don't want to, they won't).\n\nThe other one is my 31 years old cousin who has worked in the past, taken a degree (even if it took a lot of years), has quite literally the worst case of social anxiety I've ever seen, very probably some kind of undiagnosed mental illness too that hinders his capabilities of making friends, talking to people, working as a fully self sufficient human being, so to speak (I don't want to make couch diagnoses).   \nIt's not that he doesn't try, but he's visibly awkward and really isn't able to click with people, even the smallest talk is hard for him, and people notice. It's a huge problem. He's been seeing a therapist and working on it, though. Fact is, it's very difficult to get a diagnosis in my country, most therapist just prefer to ignore that aspect of life.   \nI'm convinced knowing what he has could help him, or at least work with a therapist that is specialized in X condition, but everyone in my family just says some flavour of \"today everyone has a mental illness! He just needs to tie his bootstraps and try harder!\".\n\nSometimes it makes me angry how some people get away with so much, while people who are really struggling and can't defend themselves only get misunderstood and mistreated as a result.",

I live in a college town, so I was looking for secretarial work at the University, but it always required like years of experience and knowledge of certain programs; I never heard anything back. Nor did I hear anything back from applying online for food service jobs. It got to the point where I dreaded even applying, because when it got to like previous work experience I felt like, *What's the point?* They were never gonna get back to me, anyway. The long and short of it is that I'd developed a sense of learned helplessness, but like... Before that point I had seen that term as kind of an insult, like, *You could do it if you wanted.* But this experience taught me that no, it's actually *very* difficult to get started when you believe it's impossible. That's not a conscious mindset, either: I *knew* feeling that way was a part of my problem, but I couldn't just turn it off. Actually ended up walking into both of the jobs I eventually got, and I'm pretty sure it had to do with pretty privilege. My dad and I still eventually ended up living in hotels because...

Please keep that in mind, as it may seem like I'm arguing against having courage and integrity.\n \nYou listed:\n\n> What happened at a high level.\n> * Noticed some odd metrics\n> * Gathered data and built reports\n> * Reported internally \n> * Escalated chain of command\n> * Disclosed to Congress\n\nStory time.\nWhen I worked at Arlington National Cemetery in uniform, I noticed a discrepancy on a last-minute decision to deny a soldier burial. After months of rigorous processing to ensure eligibility, leadership made the decision to deny burial the morning of the service when the family was already on site. It was very unusual.\n\nI gathered data from systems to which I had full, documented access and did a FOIA for information I did not have authorized access to. I researched the federal regulations governing eligibility in great detail and combed through relevant statute, fed regs, and DoD/Service regulations to ensure my conclusion was correct: the rationale given for denial was incorrect and based on a misunderstanding of a duty status. (For those interested, the Soldier was denied for being \"Active Duty for Training,\" which would be a legitimate ineligibility factor except it was incorrect because he was not in the Reserve Component - he had a proper active duty contract, so the duty status didn't apply to his case. He had also completed initial entry training and been awarded an MOS, which was the only other potential factor for ineligibility.)\n\nWhen I was sure I had researched everything and had the FOIA data in hand, I concluded an 8 page memo with enclosures and presented it to my chain of command indicating the Soldier was erroneously denied burial.\n\nWithin a week, I was counseled, given corrective training on the \"misuse of CUI and PII data,\" accused of improperly accessing systems (to which I had full access), and accused of wanting to hurt the family emotionally by bringing all of this up 8 months after the fact. I was then improperly directed to behavioral health and, while there, my supervisor called trying to get the results of my intake appointment.\n\nIn lieu of corrective training, as I did nothing wrong, I resigned my commission and left service 4.5 years before retirement.\n\nAfterwards, I filed two IG reports - one for the initial denial of burial and one for whistleblowing reprisal. The first validated my findings, but the DoD IG talked to my supervisor and closed the reprisal case with no standing.\n\nFor me, the system won and I walked away with a pyrrhic victory, at best.\n\nWe have an obligation to do what's right, whether in uniform or as civil servants.\n\nMy reason for posting all of this is to provide a caution that doing so bears a potential cost. Bad people in power sometimes get there because the system is made of similar people who put them there. So reporting wrongdoing, whether illegal, immoral, or unethical (or fraud, waste, and abuse), is a risk you take on and should be done carefully and with that in mind.\n\nTo that end, I fully agree with OP's lessons learned -- especially 4, 5, and 6.\n\nBecause it's changed the trajectory of my life and my family's well-being, I often consider whether I'd have done it, knowing what I know now. I still think I would have, but I would have been smarter about how.",

March 3rd - I received a call during which an ACIO stated instructions were given that we were not to adhere to SOP with the doge account creation in regards to creating records. He specifically was told that there were to be no logs or records made of the accounts created for DOGE employees. DOGE officials required the highest level of access and unrestricted access to internal systems. They were to be given what are referred to as \"tenant owner\" level accounts,\n\nwith essentially unrestricted permission to read, copy, and alter data. Note, these permissions are above even my CIO's access level to our systems. Well above what level of access is required to pull metrics, efficiency reports, and any other details that would be needed to assess utilization or usage of systems in our agency. We have built in roles that auditors can use and have used extensively in the past but would not give the ability to make changes or access subsystems without approval. The suggestion that they use these accounts instead was not open discussion.\n\nFor background: In Azure, myself and others request privileged access via a predetermined time\n\nwindow tool which requires both approval and a reason to be given each time to track actions and record keeping. The highest level I can request is the Global Admin role lhour at most. Global Admin is like the CEO of a small company within part OF a building. They control users, apps, and services like Teams, and SharePoint. Tenant Admin however possesses the owner or 'root-level controller' rights of the Azure tenant and ALL resources within it. This access is akin to the owner of the entire building that the company works in. This importantly includes the keys to the data center and all locked doors, building sign in logs, plumbing, and security cameras IE. logs). Tenant admin accounts that are compromised typically are leveraged by attackers to perform various actions and hide them from defenders and would give a traditional bad actor the ability to destroy an entire organization in seconds with only Microsoft being able to stop them. A typical scenario is the account is used to create new Azure subscriptions that don't show up under the standard dashboards and don't show up in other subscription's billing or resource lists. These hidden subscriptions typically are used by attackers to host: Virtual machines or months at a time without anyone catching it.\n\ncontainers, storage accounts, and secret apps or workloads till someone notices.

The attempts were \"near real-time,\" according to the disclosure. Those attempts were blocked, but they were especially alarming. Whoever was attempting to log in was using one of the newly created DOGE accounts ‚Äî and the person had the correct username and password, according to Berulis. While it's possible the user was disguising their location, it's highly unlikely they'd appear to be coming from Russia if they wanted to avoid suspicion, cybersecurity experts interviewed by NPR explained.\n\nOn their own, a few failed login attempts from a Russian IP address aren't a smoking gun, those cybersecurity experts interviewed by NPR said. But given the overall picture of activity, it's a concerning sign that foreign adversaries may already be searching for ways into government systems that DOGE engineers may have left exposed.\n\n\"When you move fast and break stuff, the opportunity to ride the coattails of authorized access is ridiculously easy to achieve,\" said Handorf. What he means is that if DOGE engineers left access points to the network open, it would be very easy for spies or criminals to break in and steal data behind DOGE.\n\nHe said he could also see foreign adversaries trying to recruit or pay DOGE team members for access to sensitive data. \"It would not surprise me if DOGE is accidentally compromised.\"",

Patients rarely know what matters until a trained doctor sees or hears it, so the risks of missed findings or misdirection aren‚Äôt minor, they‚Äôre built in. Even the best prompt can‚Äôt substitute for hands-on clinical judgment. There‚Äôs a real danger of overconfidence or false reassurance if people forget this, especially as LLMs get better at sounding authoritative. Your post is strong because it‚Äôs honest about these risks and doesn‚Äôt just hype the tool.

This is a classic case of narrative bias.\n\nYou didn‚Äôt ¬†provide examples of a time a doctor‚Äôs 'clinical sense' was wrong, or when a doctor missed something obvious due to fatigue or cognitive bias, or when ChatGPT or Gemini provided a genuinely life-altering insight that a whole team of doctors missed.\n\nWhy is the appointment only 15 minutes? Because of billing structures and administrative targets.\n\nWhy are doctors overworked and prone to missing things? Because of staffing shortages and burnout culture.\n\nI think you unconsciously position yourself as a hero working within these constraints, but you never question the constraints themselves.\n\nThe debate should not be about whether a doctor or an AI is 'better', but about how the fundamental design of our healthcare systems fails both patients and clinicians, forcing them to look for solutions in tech or 'intuition' rather than addressing the root cause.\n\nThe goal should be the creation of an AI-augmented healthcare system, not just an AI-augmented doctor.\n\nThis involves leveraging AI for what it does best‚Äîsifting through vast data, flagging risks, managing routine checks, and providing patients with structured information to prepare for visits.\n\nThis would liberate clinicians from administrative burdens and simple diagnostic puzzles, allowing their limited and valuable time to be dedicated to what humans do best: building rapport, navigating complex co-morbidities, discussing values and end-of-life care, and exercising the holistic, contextual judgment you rightly cherish.\n\nWe should not be using AI to help us cope with a broken system, but to help us build a new one.",

It was giant. Her dad and I argue about whether or not it‚Äôs ER trip stuff.  After sending close up images and then the video feature, Chat helps me to see its standard goose egg, monitor for concerning symptoms but probably no need to go to ER. By next am, said goose egg is tiny bump.\n\nAnother time my 11 month old opened a mosquito bite on her toe by crawling and it looked like cellulitis was developing. ChatGPT (video, and close up images) confirmed this was probably the case, and ‚Äúwe‚Äù decided urgent care (not ER, ‚Äúmild infection‚Äù)was best course of action.\n\nAlso have a third child in treatment for leukemia.

Unfortunately many docs outright dismiss concerns when patients ‚Äúdo their own research ‚Äú. Many medical providers still won‚Äôt touch chat or similar tools.\n\nThe more you already know, the more chatGPT can deepen knowledge.

That will help people to see why they can‚Äôt trust blindly period.\n\nAsk for citations and make sure those sources are trustworthy. Read them yourself. And in the case of medical, think of GPT as a tool to point in the right direction for deeper discussion with doctor - and to help you understand medical terms and relationships .

Tasks that once required years of education or experience can now be performed passably by machines in seconds. Writing, coding, composing, designing‚Äîthese were once the domains of professionals. Today, they are increasingly outputs of models.\n\nSo the natural question becomes:\nWhere does value go when capability becomes cheap and instant?\n\nThe answer is found not in what AI can do, but in what it can never become.\nThe future‚Äôs most defensible industries will not be the ones that scale the fastest‚Äîbut the ones that require lifelong cultivation of skills rooted in human experience, judgment, and presence.\n\n‚∏ª\n\nThe Core Argument\n\nStrategic differentiation will survive only where craft is irreplaceable‚Äîwhere skill is not a commodity but a calling.\n\nThese aren‚Äôt simply jobs. They‚Äôre disciplines where:\n- Mastery is inseparable from time spent\n- The outcome is shaped by intuition earned through lived failures\n- Presence, touch, and nuance are the value‚Äînot add-ons to it\n- The individual practitioner is not interchangeable, and cannot be simulated\n- Knowledge is not just technical, but embodied, moral, and context-sensitive\n\nThis doesn‚Äôt mean these industries resist technology‚Äîbut that technology cannot substitute the core offering. That core is human.\n\n‚∏ª\n\nThe Industries That Will Endure‚Äîand Command a Premium\n\nThese are not trend-chasing fields. They are disciplines of craft, refinement, and internal transformation, such as:\n- Medicine at the edge of complexity:\nWhere the diagnosis doesn‚Äôt come from a checklist, but from pattern recognition refined over 30 years. Where touch, tone, and gut feeling matter more than probabilities.\n- Fine art, music, and dance:\nNot content. Not entertainment. But art as the slow revelation of form and meaning. Where a performer doesn‚Äôt replicate‚Äîbut interprets with the weight of their own lived experience.\n- Philosophy, law, and moral reasoning:\nWhere argument is shaped by historical consciousness and ethical depth‚Äînot by prediction or popularity.\n- Craftsmanship:\nLuthiers, watchmakers, calligraphers‚Äîpeople who shape material through gesture, not through scale. Where slowness is quality.\n- Culinary mastery:\nNot just execution, but memory, palate, rhythm, and restraint‚Äîall developed over decades.\n- High-level pedagogy and mentorship:\nTeaching that adapts in real-time, to real people. Where knowing what not to say is as important as what‚Äôs taught.\n\n‚∏ª\n\nStrategic Differentiation Through Lifelong Skill\n\nIn these fields, strategic differentiation isn‚Äôt a matter of slogans or UX polish.\nIt‚Äôs embedded in:\n- The sound of the violin before the note\n- The tone of a physician‚Äôs voice when delivering uncertain news\n- The feel of a hand-carved joint sliding into place without pressure\n- The pause in a sentence, chosen by a teacher who has spent decades watching faces shift in understanding\n\nThese moments can‚Äôt be mimicked.\nThey can‚Äôt be compressed.\nAnd they can‚Äôt be replicated by AI‚Äîbecause they‚Äôre not made of data.\nThey‚Äôre made of attention, failure, time, and care.\n\n‚∏ª\n\nThe Future of Value\n\nIn a world saturated by synthetic competence, people will start to feel the weightlessness of the instant. They will hunger for depth, precision, and presence‚Äîqualities that require a human being shaped slowly by a discipline.\n\nThe most highly valued industries in the future will be those that demand a lifetime of disciplined skill development‚Äîand where AI cannot meaningfully contribute because the value doesn‚Äôt lie in speed, scalability, or prediction. It lies in the character of the practitioner, not just the quality of the product.\n\n‚∏ª\n\nThis is not a return to the past.\nIt‚Äôs a reassertion of something AI has forced us to remember:\n\nReal things, made by real people, matter.\nNot because they‚Äôre nostalgic.\nBut because they carry weight‚Äîand weight is the only thing AI can‚Äôt generate.",

      "text": "In my country, trying to get past reception to actually get a doctor's appointment in the first place is like winning the lottery. Then we put up with a different doctor or locum every time, and you have to hope the previous ones bothered to write any notes that make sense. Add to that being a woman and being a fat woman (who is always actively trying to lose weight but it doesn't seem to work) et voil√†, basically a pariah. \n\nI'd love a doctor like OP that actually sees the human and bothers to do even the most basic of diagnostics (like, I don't know actually looking at my face when speaking to me?) but it just doesn't happen here. As a woman especially, I'm ignored and told I'm \"overreacting\" all the time. \n\nCase in point: ChatGPT has helped me find the right test to see if I have a cytochrome p450 issue. If I do it means that I metabolise some drugs a lot faster than other people.\n\nWhy has chat helped? Because it actually took note when I said that anaesthetics and painkillers just don't seem to work very well, they wear off really quickly, also after a casual comment about taking a lot more alcohol than the average person to get merry (and before anyone says anything, I am a very boring person and never drink to excess now as an adult and rarely as a younger adult). It also took note when we explored a family history on one parent's side of exactly the same symptoms. \n\nNow I'm a middle aged woman, I've had multiple dental procedures throughout my life where the anesthetics didn't work properly, I've come round from general anaesthetic much quicker than the nurses expected, I've had a biopsy where the local didn't do much, I also dislocated my knee and was given morphine and told I was \"making it up, it can't still hurt. You've been given the strongest we have\". Every doctor has blamed either me for \"making it up\" or the previous doctors for \"doing it wrong\". Not one has bothered to check much less bother to take notes that maybe I know my own body.\n\nI know ChatGPT cannot replace a doctor and I respect doctors for their learning and their intuition, AI can never replace a human gut-feeling about something, but to be honest I've never had great experiences with doctors. This fantasy world where they seem to want to get someone well rather than just get them out of the door doesn't seem to exist in my experience ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I've just done a data request for my full medical records and you bet I'll be going through them now with Chat's help to gain any health insight I can. I see it as advocating for myself.",

      "text": "lol but you didn‚Äôt answer my question. There‚Äôs some specialties where it‚Äôs quite literally just pattern matching.¬†\n\nCardiologist is a mediocre example, there are many. Radiologist is the most obvious. I‚Äôm not here to argue. But putting your head in the sand and refusing to admit a lot of the job is pattern matching is silly.¬†\n\nI come from family of doctors, and am in tech personally. We discuss this quite a lot.¬†\n\nAs far as your question, I omitted part of it as bias comes into play, but here was the output¬†\n\n>¬†A well-educated, motivated doctor does much more than just pattern matching. While pattern recognition is an essential part of medical expertise, it‚Äôs only one piece of the cognitive toolkit. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the higher-level thinking and actions that distinguish truly excellent physicians:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüß† 1.¬†\n\nAnalytical Reasoning and Differential Diagnosis\n\n\n\n\n\nBeyond Pattern Matching:\n\nA competent doctor actively constructs a differential diagnosis ‚Äî a ranked list of possible explanations ‚Äî even when a patient fits a familiar pattern. This involves asking:\n\n\n\nWhat else could this be?\nWhat‚Äôs most dangerous?\nWhat doesn‚Äôt fit?\n\n\n\n\nExample:\n\nA patient presents with a headache. A lazy pattern match might assume ‚Äúmigraine.‚Äù A great doctor considers meningitis, temporal arteritis, aneurysm, cluster headaches, and even carbon monoxide poisoning ‚Äî and rules them out systematically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüß© 2.¬†\n\nProbabilistic and Bayesian Thinking\n\n\n\n\n\nThinking in Degrees of Certainty:\n\nDoctors constantly update their beliefs as new information comes in (labs, imaging, response to treatment). They don‚Äôt just ask, ‚ÄúIs this disease present or not?‚Äù but ‚ÄúHow likely is it now, compared to before?‚Äù\n\n\n\nExample:\n\nA doctor starts with a 30% pre-test probability for pulmonary embolism, and based on a D-dimer and imaging, updates their probability dynamically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüß¨ 3.¬†\n\nIntegrating Complex, Conflicting Data\n\n\n\n\n\nSynthesis over Recognition:\n\nReal-world cases rarely align cleanly with textbook descriptions. A great doctor can reconcile vague, conflicting, or incomplete information (e.g. noisy lab values, non-specific symptoms) into a coherent clinical picture.\n\n\n\nExample:\n\nA patient has fever, fatigue, and anemia. Is this infection? Autoimmune disease? Cancer? A top doctor can see through confounders and synthesize a plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüß™ 4.¬†\n\nHypothesis Testing through Action\n\n\n\n\n\nTherapeutic Trials as Experiments:\n\nDoctors may initiate treatment not just to heal, but to learn. This is an implicit use of the scientific method.\n\n\n\nExample:\n\nTrialing steroids in a patient with ambiguous autoimmune symptoms to observe response ‚Äî not just to treat, but to test the hypothesis of immune dysfunction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë 5.¬†\n\nNavigating Human Complexity and Communication\n\n\n\n\n\nEmpathy + Persuasion + Education:\n\nDoctors aren‚Äôt just diagnosticians. They manage emotions, explain risk, and align decisions with patient values. They interpret nonverbal cues, negotiate treatment plans, and respond to the human reality of illness.\n\n\n\nExample:\n\nHelping a skeptical patient understand why they need anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation ‚Äî without resorting to fear or oversimplification.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n‚öñÔ∏è 6.¬†\n\nEthical Reasoning and Judgment Under Uncertainty\n\n\n\n\n\nTradeoffs, Not Algorithms:\n\nThere‚Äôs rarely a single ‚Äúright‚Äù answer. Doctors weigh risk vs. benefit, cost vs. gain, survival vs. quality of life.\n\n\n\nExample:\n\nDeciding whether to pursue aggressive chemotherapy in an elderly patient with advanced cancer and other comorbidities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüèõÔ∏è 7.¬†\n\nKnowledge Updating and Metacognition\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-awareness + Learning:\n\nExcellent doctors are aware of their own biases and limitations. They reflect, learn, and improve. They also recognize cognitive traps: anchoring, premature closure, confirmation bias.\n\n\n\nExample:\n\nAdmitting that they might have missed a diagnosis, re-evaluating assumptions, and reopening the case ‚Äî even if it means challenging their ego.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüõ†Ô∏è 8.¬†\n\nSystem Navigation and Advocacy\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking the System:\n\nDoctors don‚Äôt just operate in isolation ‚Äî they coordinate with specialists, advocate for patients through bureaucratic barriers, and sometimes bend rules to serve the patient best.\n\n\n\nExample:\n\nPushing for a non-covered MRI because clinical intuition suggests something subtle but dangerous.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\n\n\nA well-educated, motivated doctor operates like a scientist, detective, educator, communicator, and ethicist ‚Äî not a pattern-matching machine. They reason under uncertainty, update beliefs dynamically, balance risks with values, and adapt to the unique human in front of them. Pattern recognition may help them get started ‚Äî but it‚Äôs all these other faculties that define excellence.\n\n\n\n\nMost of these to me, fall under pattern matching. With the exception of 6 and 8. Keep in mind I specified good doctor.¬†\n\nI‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôve ever seen an admit they‚Äôre wrong, and I‚Äôve seen plenty of doctors.¬†\n\nAverage bed side manner is terrible. That‚Äôs 5/7, sometimes 8¬†\n\n\n1,2,3,4 is the definition of pattern matching on a loop.",

      "text": "Flattery is not my style. \n\nA lot of people even at the expert level: \n\n1. Anthropomorphize LLMs and ascribe attributes like \"reasoning\" and \"thinking\" that they do not possess. (True, distilled reasoning is symbolic, hierarchical and nonlinear. LLM reasoning is fuzzy, nondeterministic, and linear.)\n\n2. Vastly overestimate their reasoning abilities. I have had real arguments on the topic of AI and nukes. How is a nuke launched? By the push of a button, with much procedure and ceremony, OR automatically as a second strike. \n\nA lot of the physical level abilities needed don't exist with AI for this. Specifically, the ability to open the nuclear football and manually push that button. It's a piece of code on a server! It can only hack into insecure network-connected devices. No, an LLM won't be able to breach secure servers because unlike the hacks working in ML, the crypto people use formal proofs!   \n  \nAnd a lot of them use the \"what if an LLM convinces someone (bribe etc) to do it?\"  \n  \n... you think the KGB haven't tried that? You think the CIA and NSA are not aware of that attack route? Turning people is literally half of what intelligence guys do. \n\n3. Assume that existing limitations are merely a matter of scale. Or little details to be just ironed out.\n\n\\---------------------------\n\nA lot of your observations can be traced back to the theoretical foundations of LLMs, while some others are well-observed empirical results that are still unsolved problems.\n\nIt is my belief that there are a lot of rich-corpus-small-context use cases for LLMs that are being ignored or downplayed. In general, unstructured information retrieval tasks from a well-characterized albeit fuzzy corpus, should be simple enough if the training is very purpose-driven. ChatGPT is NOT purpose-driven and is a generalist. I imagine the more rare the suggested diagnosis, the more hilariously wrong it is. \n\nChatGPT's bias towards validating the user's confirmation bias is actually a major but solvable flaw IMO originating from both the tendency of datasets to include agreement examples than disagreement examples as well as reinforcement of that in the training steps involving human feedback. We need the LLM to be exposed to much more <factual> disagreement. Both at the corpus stage and at the human feedback stage. \n\nLLMs yes-man-isms is actually one of the first things I tested, in the mental health emergency context. Some LLMs have validated and thus inflamed the suicidal thoughts of some users, with fatal consequences in a few cases. OpenAI and the other big names are smart and have manually guardrailed that case, but for every manually guardrailed edge scenario there are so many more dangerous scenarios that are not guarded.\n\nThe response of some in the LLM community (even the execs) is to treat these cases as user error. That is laughable, because nearly all safety-critical industries view habitual user error as a design flaw that needs urgent plugging. Aviation, especially.",

Why do you think you are above criticism, but what he says about others who chose to be teachers are not? Those who chose that career are most likely kinder and smarter than most people. And you say you would start looking at garbage men differently if he chose that career. Why not simply respect people until they give you a good reason to disrespect them instead?",

I can see a version of this post that, for example, discusses the current crisis in UK higher education or the large Dutch funding cuts from earlier this year, to take two possible examples. Many - maybe most - university and research systems are under some kind of pressure, in my own view because of the broad turn towards neoliberal models of governance and public involvement that just don't fit the sector well. These are complex, important issues that transcend the US.\n\nBut I think that it's important to recognise that we are not talking here about this kind of 'normal' mismanagement or policy failure. What we're seeing is a wholesale dismantling of what has up to now been the largest and most influential public research sector in the world. It's unprecedented in scope and effect, and worth calling out on those terms. \n\nIn terms of what research looks like in Russia (or China etc), I think our views on intellectual freedom and the relationship between researchers and the state can be readily inferred through our values without having to pre-emptively list every single other context we have problems with. Russia is not a democratic society, and the mechanisms through which we hope change or resistance might be effected in the context of the United States do not exist in the same way. We are also not a Russian-language forum, and broadly do not expect we could speak to the right audience as usefully as we can here.",

They WILL probably let you in for a time on a work visa if someone hired you tho. Spending that time working in canada, plus a high level of education is the best way to get in, and it's possible to get high enough even if you have an age score of 0 on the [Candiate Ranking System](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/check-score/crs-criteria.html). [The current bar is about 450/600](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/mandate/policies-operational-instructions-agreements/ministerial-instructions/express-entry-rounds.html#wb-auto-4) for healthcare, trades, and french language speakers. Around 530 or higher for other highly educated professionals (which you more likely fall into on this subreddit). With an age score of 0, those bars would definitely require you to work in Canada for a good while beforehand and have a very high level of education, probably a doctorate for the 530 one. (technically, with an age score of 0, you can still get a perfect 600/600, but that's at an *extremely* high bar)\n\nThat's a huge commitment without any guarantees, but not an impossible barrier if someone were committed. I get where you're coming from tho, sounds like you're probably more than a bit over 30 and it would be fairly unfeasible to make such a commitment.\n\nHave you looked into the provincial nominee programs? Most Canadian provinces have their own programs with their own criteria that grant automatic 600 points on the CRS score for permanent residency. They seem kinda sus to me, but might be worth looking into.\n\nI'm not trying to be a pushy advocate, it just sounded to me like emigrating and your options for doing so is something you care about so I wanted to figure out if there were ways around that age barrier. This is mostly coming from a desire to help find options, and a curiosity on my end driving me to look into what exactly the bar is for immigration into my country.",

People will likely downvote you on instinct here, but I hope they pause and ask why.\n\nI appreciate the kind words, and I can answer the second question - it‚Äôs because any deviation from the established narrative must be suppressed at all costs. We can‚Äôt have wrongthink happening. \n\n>It doesn't seem rational at all to assume this enormous 58B number is by default the \"right number allocated to the right priorities,\" and there are clear examples where thats not the case. Percentage based math on a federal budget is enormously naive framing.\n\nI‚Äôm not even all that sussed about the big number - but to say that the big number isn‚Äôt a big deal because there are bigger numbers makes me think that you‚Äôre hiding things in the big number and hoping that no one notices. \n\n>I also don't agree with the guns-blazing \"chainsaw\" approach of DOGE and there are clear area where they've fucked up (the ebola one comes to mind immediately, although they did reverse that quickly)... But I'm entirely unconvinced by the assumption that this volume of money is \"the right volume\" without serious public oversight and review.\n\nI think that the DOGE-chainsaw approach was/is moronic in almost every way, but at the same time, we‚Äôve seen over and over again the results of ‚Äúwe‚Äôll investigate it, chair a commission, wait 2 years for their results, then bring in 5 working groups to identify changes, then based on the recommendations of those working groups we‚Äôll staff up 18 new policy proposal boards to seek public input‚Ä¶‚Äù and now we‚Äôre 5 years down the road and nothing has changed. \n\nI‚Äôm reminded of a recent podcast appearance with Jon Stewart on Ezra Klein‚Äôs podcast about the pure absurdity of the Rural Broadband project under BBB, from year 1 of Biden. We‚Äôre now 4 years from when it passed, and not a single person has been connected to the internet using dollars from that program. \n\n>I'll unfortunately/reluctantly inject my own political 2c here in that while I'm a self described progressive/democrat -- it's been exhausting seeing the default stance of many on this side of the spectrum as \"we need to oppose the other side on every decision, and assume bad intent.\" Or that if someone in the middle disagrees with certain points, they're fully assumed as a mindless robot or politically compromised, lol.\n\nYou‚Äôd like the podcast I mentioned above - https://youtu.be/NcZxaFfxloo\n\n>There's IMO a clear \"time to think rationally about what needs to change, and influence that direction.\" This is a time for nuanced consideration and smart influencing of future policy (and no I don't think DOGE is doing that rn) -- but I don't view it as an existential threat to the future of scientific investment, and that doesn't seem like a productive line of thinking. It's a time to reevaluate and fix an inefficient system. That doesn't mean I agree with most of what DOGE is doing ... But in this instance I'm very aligned with your perspective.\n\nSo - I really think that this gets into a core tenet of American society - it is anathema for any individual to admit they were ever wrong about anything, and certainly for an organization to do so. \n\nThe AAP has **still** not apologized for their fake science that resulted in *millions* of American and Canadian children (and now adults) having life-threatening peanut allergies - likely because they are terrified of the legal implications, but also because an admission of guilt would erode their public support and the general principles of ‚Äúlisten to the scientists.‚Äù\n\nSee also the debate on the origins of COVID-19 - the absolute insistence of anyone in power that a lab leak was absolutely impossible was taken (rightly) as something that was bad science, and defies basic logic. People *knew* they were being lied to, and the coordinated efforts of government and media made them grow distrustful of the moral and scientific authority that was so badly needed at that point in time. \n\nIt‚Äôs the same line of logic as to objections to scientific research I outline above - if they‚Äôre lying to me about X, why should I trust them to tell me the truth about Y.\n\nUnfortunately, this is going to be partisan - and it shouldn‚Äôt be. It should be an excellent opportunity for self-reckoning, discussion, and guarantees to do better going forward. \n\nBut it won‚Äôt, and that‚Äôs a travesty.",

I'm not a music theorist, but having now read the paper, this seems to be exactly what you're doing.\n\n>But when someone starts arguing its very¬†*grammatical structure*¬†is racist\n\nFrom my reading, that doesn't seem to be what Yust is doing. Rather, he's arguing that the word \"tonality\" is not a particularly accurate or useful way to describe the grammatical qualities of music, rather, that it is a categorization that emerged from a specific historical context - one inexorably associated with colonialism and white supremacy. See, for example, his statement on page 68\n\n>It might sound at this point as though I am ready to discard all the music theory that has been done in the name of tonality (including my own), but that is not at all the case. The important question is not how deeply this or that theoretical project is tarnished by structural racism encoded in the concept of tonality, but whether the concept of tonality plays an essential role in each theoretical project and, if so, what role does it play?\n\nYust goes on to say than rather than glossing all this variation as \"tonality\", it would be better to use specific terms, like those listed beginning on page 69. \n\nAgain, I'm not a music theorist, but this is strikingly similar to the history of categorization in linguistics and linguistic anthropology. From the colonial period to the 19th (or even 20th) century, European and American linguists went around the world documenting exotic and \"disappearing\" languages, including many of the Native languages of the Americas. They tried to figure out what \"grammatical categories\" those languages had, but they were always compared to Indo-European standards. Thus, to strawman a bit, \"this language doesn't have a grammatical structure made up of distinguishable nouns and verbs (many did, it just went unrecognized, but that's a separate argument) therefore these people are primitive savages!\" The same kind of grammatical misrepresentation/miscategorization is where you end up with factoid-myths like \"[the Eskimo have so many different words for snow](https://cslc.nd.edu/assets/141348/pullum_eskimo_vocabhoax.pdf)!\"  (which, ironically, came from Franz Boas' much more nuanced and contextual approach to Inuit language).\n\nWe could go on with the parallels in anthropology - including the persistence of racial categories (caucasoid, mongoloid, etc) by some practitioners well after they were undermined by data. I don't want to substitute one field for my own, I'm just trying to point out that the strawmanning of \"we shouldn't use this word, its RACIST\" is often actually \"we shouldn't use this word, because the phenomenon is better and more accurately described by other terms, **and (less importantly)** it has a problematic history\".\n\n(Edit to try and fix formatting errors)",

Site administrator once hosted a TV show on Russia State TV\n- A strange, unexpected policy change occurs at RNC convention, the change is a less supportive position toward Ukraine and is advantageous to Russia\n- candidate‚Äôs campaign manager goes on CNN and asserts a false terrorist attack in Turkey, one tied to and advanced by Russian propaganda\n- during this time, you watch a campaign associate tweet with a Russian account that‚Äôs pointing people to stolen documents from the opposing campaign. The campaign associate predicts something will happen to the opposing campaign manager- his emails are later released\n- as Election Day approaches, Presidential candidate makes allegation, without evidence, voter Fraud & Election Rigging, Russia propaganda echoes this, social media accounts associated Kremlin do the same, at same time, you watch Russian Hackers hit state election infrastructure\n- After election, current President issues sanctions against Russia, but the incoming National Security advisor makes calls to Russian officials from 3rd country, when approached for clarification post inauguration, the advisor lies about contents of phone call w/Russian officials\n- During summer fall leading into the election, you receive raw intelligence from highly reliable source whose proven invaluable on other investigations. source provides intelligence on Russia‚Äôs efforts to support a presidential candidate, the info is consistent with other info\n- Before inauguration your bosses, your leaders from all intelligence agencies brief president elect on classified info showing Russia influenced the election on behalf of President elect. President elect rejects intelligence from all your superiors and suggests Russia innocent\n- From the summer of 2015 all the way through the election and after inauguration, you watch as the candidate, president elect and now president offers overt effusive support for Vladimir Putin who you know has been helping the President get elected.\n- Shortly after inauguration, your new commander-in-chief spouts false information about Polish aggression toward Belarus. This is not supported by the Intelligence community you are in, and the only source for this viewpoint is Russian propaganda\n- After firing of National Security Advisor that lies to you agencies investigators, the President corners your boss 1-1 asks him to go easy on National Security Advisor who lies about his conversation with Russians\n- During this period, the President inexplicably and repeatedly asks your boss if he‚Äôs under investigation with regards to Russia, despite your boss and other intel heads going out of their way to brief the President about Kremlin efforts to potentially compromise & manipulate him\n- While Congressional committees investigate Russian interference, the President fires your boss for his handling of an email investigation into the President‚Äôs opponent, an investigation that helped elevate the President rather than hurt him\n- You later find out a draft memo from President to your boss regarding his firing cited the Russia investigation\n- The President then goes on national television and in an interview says he fired your boss because of the Russia investigation\n- A week after firing your boss, the President invites Russian leaders into the Oval Office, Russian photographers capture the moment, but US media is not allowed to observe. President then brags to Russian leaders about firing your boss\n- Sometime during the spring, if you‚Äôre not already aware, you read a news story alleging the President‚Äôs son-in-law may have sought a way to communicate with Russia via a back channel not monitored by you and your colleagues\n- During summer, you watch the President attend NATO summit and shove Montenegro PM, in an Interview claim Montenegro is aggressive, might start a war. This mirrors Russian propaganda & you know Russia backed covert operation destabilize Montenegrin election\n- For next year, either you, your colleagues and your organization, FBI, are discredited by President. He mixes true and false information in public disclosures which you are not allowed to respond to. If you do respond, your accused of leaking and could be fired or even jailed\n- Documents & information from confidential sources you‚Äôve pledged to protect, are selectively leaked into public through those who are supposed to provide government oversight. These inappropriate disclosures make your job as an investigator nearly impossible & hurts your sources\n- At some point during the summer or before, you learn that the President‚Äôs son was receiving & responding to direct messages from website that was releasing emails stolen from the President‚Äôs opponent by Russia\n- 1st two years President‚Äôs term, you watch him take a negative, adversarial stance toward NATO and particularly Germany. This strains your relationship with your most valuable intel partners, your Counterterrorism agent colleagues depend on them & they help fight war on terror\n- Over next 2 years, President aggressively seeks meetings with Putin who helped elect him. Need for meetings is not clear. one President meets in private with Putin for 2 hours without witnesses but translator. To this day, you, your bosses don‚Äôt really know what was discussed\n- President emerges from private meeting with Putin and on world stage in Helsinki accepts and validates Russian denials about election interference & rejects years of your teams intel work. This badly damages your reputation and partner trust with your organization\n- Separately, your President publicly discusses a Russian proposed partnership on cyber security, this insane concept is mind boggling to you as an investigator as you‚Äôve just spent years tracking these same Russians who just attacked your country\n- Even further, your President publicly mentions a possible exchange where Russian investigators might interview and interrogate you and other Americans about their attack on you and America. A crazy, frightening and bizarre threat to you as a civil servant.\n- Throughout your investigation into Russian interference, you watch as your President‚Äôs attacks on the Special Counsel, Justice Department & FBI are amplified and spread in America by the very Russian troll social media accounts and state sponsored propaganda you are investigating\n- Throughout the Special Counsel indictments, hearings and trials, you watch the President and his legal team publicly interject, discredit witnesses and discuss pardons, all subverting the rule of law and justice which you‚Äôve dedicated your life to protect and defend\n- You either know or learn a parallel investigation shows Russians representing a bogus Russian gun rights movement penetrated the political party hosting members who‚Äôve tried to discredit you - you recognize this as a TEXTBOOK espionage/influence op you learned at FBI academy\n- After two years, the Attorney General over you, who appropriately recused himself from Russia investigation, is fired for seemingly no clear reason after taking public lashings from the President\n- Your AG is replaced by an acting AG whose unqualified for position, has limited experience justify such high level appointment, you‚Äôve watched him on TV discrediting your agency and your team‚Äôs investigation despite seeing none of evidence or knowing anything Russian influence\n- The same month, the President‚Äôs personal lawyer pleads guilty in federal court and says he continued negotiations throughout almost the entire Presidential campaign for a Tower in Moscow. This is in opposition to President‚Äôs public denials.\n- You read public reporting that the best apartment in the Moscow Tower project pursued by the President‚Äôs business was offered to Russia‚Äôs President Putin, the same Putin your President always sides with over you and your agency, the Putin who helped your President win\n- You either knew or learned through a redaction error that the President‚Äôs campaign manager was alleged to have lied about providing polling data to a Russian whom he owed money, via a former Russian GRU contact\n\n/- Clint Watts\"",

The poor conditions of non-white communities in cities that increase the likelihood of becoming a criminal is more of a national emergency. But these aren't what the national emergency system is for.. it's for devastating terrorist attacks and invasion of a foreign military and not fucking \"oh a bunch of Mexicans, most of which are just normal people looking for a better life, are hopping the fence at the border and the people that voted for me are angry about it..\"",

If Warren drops her voters would likely split between Biden and Sanders, but more heavily to Sanders. If Sanders drops, most would go to Warren. For Sanders to win, Warren (but *only* Warren would) have to drop early. If the more center-y Dems drop early, it swings back to Biden.",

From what I remember, all their decisions are reasonable and make sense to me. Though if you follow nate silver and nate cohen on Twitter, they had a really interesting discussion recently about how pollster scores might be out of date (pollster changing their methods can affect their \"true\" house effect).\n\nYou should also keep in mind, while nate (and others) are making reasonable methodology decisions, they are often based on assumptions, so if those assumptions dont hold true on election day, then they can hurt more than they help.",

      "text": "Sorry, I may be of boomer age, but I don't have a boomer attitude (or rather, I still have that boomer attitude from when we fought the Vietnam war). It's not smart to presume Biden has a better chance at beating Trump. Biden is damaged goods, much more damaged than any other Dem candidate. And Trump will expound on that all day long, every day, and will be successful -- because while there is no evidence that the Bidens actually did anything outright corrupt, the appearance is there, and this sort of nepotism-adjacent influence peddling smells bad, even if that's just the way of things among the ruling class. And the ruling class isn't in favor at this point.\n\nSeriously, *anyone* who wins the primaries can do it (including Biden, though it would be harder for him). I get really tired of the stupid \"electability\" argument. Even Hillary with historically bad (for a Dem) favorables was just 77k votes short. Anyone without her baggage can do it, and nobody in the field still running has her baggage. Plus, this time we know exactly what we got with Trump; he's no longer someone where people can imagine that he might do some good things, like make better trade deals or end foreign wars. We know what he does, and we know exactly how crappy it is.\n\nThen it comes down to who would inspire the highest turnout, because that's how you most easily get those votes Hillary left on the floor. And this is where I fear a Biden nomination because he seems to only excite the old and staid and those who have Obama nostalgia; I can see even milquetoasty Buttigieg excite more young people because at least he's young himself and doesn't have the truly mediocre legislative record of Biden, nor the disconnected, patronizing attitude Biden has towards the young. Yes, Biden has a more faithful black following, again, mostly among the older folks, but is it better than what Clinton had? I don't think it's even as good. Are older blacks going to stay home for any other Dem? I don't see that happening either. They go and vote no matter what; the volatility in turnout lies elsewhere.\n\nSo, IMO anyone can beat Trump if they turn out the Dem base and get some excitement going among young voters. It won't be the cakewalk it rightfully should be, but it's eminently doable. It's not like he has expanded his own base in the last 3 years. That's why I am much more concerned with progressive coat tails in downticket races and actual desire to implement policies that benefit the people, after the election.",

      "text": "30 year low crime rate in DC before he took over. It's not safer now, if anything law enforcement has stepped up trampling on peoples civil rights. What a odd question to ask, you \"heard\" something. Violation of civil rights is the only increase in crime rates. Trump's an evil POS.\n\nMemphis, Tennessee, Nashville, Tennessee, Louisville, Kentucky, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, Kansas City, Missouri, Tulsa, Oklahoma, St. Louis, Missouri, Little Rock, Arkansas, Birmingham, Alabama, Tucson, Arizona are red state cities that have worse crime rates, why isn't the National Guard and all feds going there?\n\n\nBehold:\n\nUsing only data from the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program is an excellent way to get a more standardized comparison. It is important to remember, however, that the UCR data can have limitations, as not all agencies participate or provide a full year of data. The UCR program also switched from the Summary Reporting System (SRS) to the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS), which can cause some inconsistencies in historical data.\n\nBased on recent UCR data and analyses of it, here is a re-evaluated list of cities in \"red states\" (those that have consistently voted Republican in recent presidential elections) that have a higher violent crime rate than Washington, D.C., with a population size as close as possible to D.C.'s.\n\nWashington, D.C.'s violent crime rate, while high, fluctuates. For context, in recent years, its violent crime rate has been reported to be around 925.9 violent crimes per 100,000 residents.\n\nHere are 10 cities that fit the criteria, based on available UCR data.\n\n1.  **Memphis, Tennessee:** A clear standout in many UCR data analyses, Memphis (population around 613,000) consistently ranks among the highest in the nation for violent crime. Its rate is often significantly higher than D.C.'s.\n2.  **Nashville, Tennessee:** With a population very similar to D.C.'s (around 698,000), Nashville's violent crime rate, while lower than Memphis, has also been consistently higher than D.C.'s in recent years.\n3.  **Louisville, Kentucky:** Kentucky is a red state. Louisville's population is similar to D.C.'s at around 676,000. UCR data shows that its violent crime rate has been higher than D.C.'s.\n4.  **Oklahoma City, Oklahoma:** Oklahoma is a reliably red state. With a population of over 709,000, Oklahoma City is another close population match to D.C. UCR data shows its violent crime rate to be consistently higher than the national average, and often higher than D.C.'s.\n5.  **Kansas City, Missouri:** Missouri is a red state. While its population (around 500,000) is slightly smaller than D.C.'s, its high per capita violent crime rate is a consistent feature in UCR reports, often exceeding D.C.'s.\n6.  **Tulsa, Oklahoma:** With a population of around 410,000, Tulsa is smaller than D.C., but its per capita violent crime rate is consistently high in UCR data and often surpasses D.C.'s.\n7.  **St. Louis, Missouri:** While its city-proper population (around 280,000) is much smaller than D.C.'s, St. Louis's homicide rate, a key component of violent crime, is frequently at or near the top of the UCR list for U.S. cities, almost always higher than D.C.'s.\n8.  **Little Rock, Arkansas:** Arkansas is a red state. While the population is much smaller than D.C.'s (under 200,000), Little Rock is often cited in UCR-based analyses for having an extremely high violent crime rate on a per capita basis, higher than D.C.'s.\n9.  **Birmingham, Alabama:** Alabama is a red state. Like Little Rock, Birmingham's population is significantly smaller than D.C.'s (around 200,000), but its per capita violent crime rate is consistently among the highest in the nation, based on UCR data, and is higher than D.C.'s.\n10. **Tucson, Arizona:** Arizona is a red-leaning swing state. With a population of around 540,000, Tucson's violent crime rate has, at various times, been reported as higher than D.C.'s.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n* **FBI's Crime Data Explorer (CDE):** The official source for UCR data, providing quarterly and annual statistics for agencies that submit data.\n* **Council on Criminal Justice (CCJ):** A nonpartisan organization that analyzes and reports on UCR and other crime data, providing insights into trends in major U.S. cities.\n* **Various media and think tank analyses of UCR data:** News organizations and research groups frequently analyze the raw UCR data to create rankings and reports on crime rates by city.",

I also find myself looking back on the last 40 or so years of our country's history and am greatly troubled and conflicted when I see that older generations seem not to have led us forward in step with the values that they worked so hard to instill in my generation. I was taught that I should be loving and kind, and have watched my country kill in the name of maintaining a perception of power and point to real US citizens as the dangerous \"other\". I was taught to be giving and generous, and yet all I seem to hear is complaints about people in need \"leaching\" off the system, while those with money and power take without regard for who they hurt. I was taught that our world is a beautiful and wondrous place, and that with every action we should try to leave it even just a hair better than how we found it, and yet I see that our world is burning as our climate changes, our oceans are poisoned by plastic and oil in the name of corporate greed, and that the treasure of our national parks are being stripped for parts to make a cheap buck. I was taught that every American, regardless of race, creed, or origin gets an equal say in how our country is run, and all I hear about is gerrymandered districts, voter disfranchisement, and how an overwhelming majority of Americans want people who love each other to be able to marry one another, women to have easy access to the healthcare they need and deserve, as is their right as human beings, and common sense gun reform so that those who should not have a firearm can not obtain one to stop children from dying. I'm angry that we don't seem to be making any significant progress in any of these arenas and I want to know how you plan to help.  \n\n\nI have 3 questions for you.  \n1) What makes you different from the people that have come before you, and what lessons have you drawn from their mistakes?  \n2) What policies do you have that distinguish you from the sea of other democratic candidates especially those that have many policy positions that are quite similar to your own?  \n3) How will you attempt to prove to my generation of voters, and the next generation that will be coming to the voting booth for the first time, that at the age of 67, you are not more of the same, and are actually in touch with the issues and values that will mold this country long after you are gone?",

These scam artists\n\"attend\" diploma mill schools where they obtain a \"degree\" in naturopathy or even MDs from very \"prestigious\" *wink wink* schools!\n\nLike a degree in naturopathy from this university inside this [tiny plaza in Santa Fe](https://www.google.com/maps/uv?hl=en&pb=!1s0x8718503f8ae390d1:0x57c63147abaade9c!2m22!2m2!1i80!2i80!3m1!2i20!16m16!1b1!2m2!1m1!1e1!2m2!1m1!1e3!2m2!1m1!1e5!2m2!1m1!1e4!2m2!1m1!1e6!3m1!7e115!4s/maps/place/university%2Bof%2Bnatural%2Bmedicine%2Bnew%2Bmexico/@35.6888729,-105.9450018,3a,75y,26.12h,90t/data%3D*213m4*211e1*213m2*211svyGX6vvUurBjyRWln4WryA*212e0*214m2*213m1*211s0x8718503f8ae390d1:0x57c63147abaade9c?sa%3DX!5suniversity+of+natural+medicine+new+mexico+-+Google+Search&imagekey=!1e2!2svyGX6vvUurBjyRWln4WryA&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjV-v_UiInjAhXXX80KHcgLCGIQpx8wEHoECAsQBg)!\n\nOr an MD from IUHS university in the conference room of the [Marriott Resort and Royal Casino in Saint Kitts](https://www.google.com/maps/place/St.+Kitts+Marriott+Resort+%26+The+Royal+Beach+Casino/@17.292751,-62.6876647,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m8!3m7!1s0x8c121b957e1d8f43:0x3a4e4863fa50d2f!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d17.292751!4d-62.685476)!\n\nThese ‚Äúdoctors‚Äù fraudulently present themselves as accomplished individuals that went on to finish clinical rotations, but these people really performed scam school \"observerships\".\nI can't actually post my example for the shady place that provides \"clinical rotations\" in Massachusetts, because it might be considered doxxxing since it's just\nsomeone's house in the middle of a suburban residential area! (PM me and I can send you a private message with it).\n\nNaturopaths in Colorado use [fake medical machines](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/how-one-mans-invention-is-part-of-a-growing-worldwide-scam-that-snares-the-desperately-ill/) to make false diagnoses of everything from allergies to cancer.

This is literally what killed Steve Jobs, brilliant but gullible man that he was.\n\nedit: and since I'm way at the bottom of the thread and i'm pretty sure you're never going to see this, let me just take a moment to say \"Wicky Wacky Woo Wah Hey Yabba Dabba Doo\"",

This seems to be what is happening now. DeVos, for instance, does not believe in Public Education, so she is trying to cut it wherever possible in order to undermine its function; in a business, a department can be reduced if a CEO or department head does not believe in it or believes it is inefficient or ineffective, even when the view is misguided or in absence of facts. Most concerning to me is that it goes against the public will. Will your leadership result in this?",

But I won't be surprised if it goes red and here's why:\n\n- A lot of people live in small towns/rural areas where factories have closed down or moved so Trump has the \"bring back jobs\" crowd covered here\n\n- Ohio has a large population of Somalian refugees/immigrants, so Trump has the \"kick out all the foreigners we don't want no refugees\" people covered\n\n- Somalians also tend to be mostly Muslim and I frequently see the women in burqas and hijabs at grocery stores etc, so Trump has the \"my neighbors are probs terrorists and want to implement sharia law\" crowd covered, plus the racist crowd\n\n- A lot of companies here still operate on the old boys club so you can bet his sexist actions didn't bother as many as it should have.\n\nIf this were a normal election I think Ohio would still maintain it's bellwether status, but because of how absolutely absurd it is, it's as though Trump is appealing directly to a percentage of Ohioans who would not normally support R, and/or would not vote at all.\n\nThere's still a good chance Ohio is just changing in general and may work it's way towards just being more Republican, but I would be equally unsurprised if they went back to bellwether after this election.\n\nAs an anecdotal experience, it's worth noting that plenty of people in Ohio have also only registered and voted to go against Trump. I personally was not registered to vote until Trump won the primary. I like Hillary quite a lot and so I would consider my vote to be for her and not against Trump, but the initial motivation was to stop Trump.\n\nThat all said, we'll see what happens. If Ohio goes red, I will be disappointed but not surprised.",

[Screenshot of the message in question](https://imgur.com/a/RwZjX).\n\nI brought this up in January metathread, and one of the mods said \"this doesn't seem right, can you reply to the message.\" I did, and *never heard back.* I responded to the mod a second time. I responded again to the original message. I never got another response.\n\nIn the February metathread, I spoke with another mod who told me \"that's not what the mod meant to say.\" In fact, this mod actively tried to insert words into the other mods mouth through saying \"oh, they meant to say that there was no political content in the article.\" This, once again, is bullshit. The article talks about Roy Moore's campaign, the allegations against him, among a myriad of other on-topic subjects. [Finally, the mod tried to suggest that articles about fires in Trump's properties have been removed](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/7xza7b/february_2018_meta_thread/dudkuxw/). Once again, [this is a outright lie](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/7p1iqt/its_monday_and_trump_tower_already_caught_on_fire/).\n\nIn the March metathread, a mod I had blocked due to inappropriate comments responded, but I could not see it.\n\nIn the April metathread, this comment was removed because I linked the moderator who I had blocked from the March metathread. When I fixed the error, the mod in question refused to reinstate it, instead saying he \"was going to see a movie\" and couldn't be bothered. This comment was gilded, and was #2 from the top at the time. Said comment is STILL not reinstated. After this incident, meta-threads were discontinued for some reason. \n\nI'm tired of the moderators in this community pretending to care until people stop looking in their direction. After ***ELEVEN MONTHS*** months, can I get a straight answer, *please?* Just admit that removing the submission was wrong, and allow it to be reposted.",

He's winning the Senior vote by a 14 point swing from what Trump won it in 2016.  He's winning the independent vote by a lot.  He's winning the suburban vote by a lot.  He's winning with blacks, hispanics, LGBTQ, Jews, Asians, etc.  He's winning the white college educated vote.  He's barely losing the white uneducated vote - a like 26 point swing from Hillary's margin in 2016.  He has thousands of Republicans who voted in 2016 for Trump now voting for Biden.  He has Republican veteran groups endorsing him. He has dozens and dozens of former Republican DoJ officials, he has dozens of former Republican staffers and former Republican members of Congress.  He has Ted Cruz' running mate, Carly Fiorini endorsing him.  He has Colin Powell endorsing him.\n\nHow do you have this broad of support from every demographic, and still only be averaging 8 points nationally, and in some very tight races in several swing states?

His speaking style made it easy to project your own beliefs onto him, and he was also in the very opportune position to completely reinvent the religious right.  When you start looking around at his other supporters, and you see it's /pol/ + /r/circlejerk, you start asking yourself what company you're in.  I hated Hillary for what she did to Bernie, but I really really hate how /r/the_Dumbfucks are trying to co-opt Bernie supporters' indignation as if they didn't spend the last 10 months calling us cucks.  They are as disingenuous as their hero, and this entertainment style politics where yesterday never happened is the most dangerous political wave I've seen in my short life.\n\nI've come to terms with it, I'm not staying at home, I'll vote for Hillary.",

I'd go as far to say it's as he's a white nationalist at that, and his base (who form 35%-40% of the electorate and a majority of the GOP voter base as far as I know) of what the data suggests are mainly undereducated white men without college degrees are threatened by the changes to their status in society over the last several decades. So they see him as their only hope to reverse that from what I have seen from his support.",

That's not so surprising: Interpreting confidence intervals is a subtle thing, and calling them \"margins of error\" in common usage really only confuses things.\n\nFor example:\n> ... Social science typically uses 95% -- in other words 5% probability that what you're observing happened by random chance and not because it was an unfair coin.\n\nFrom (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval)\n> Confidence intervals are frequently misunderstood, and published studies have shown that even professional scientists often misinterpret them.\n>\n>   A 95% confidence interval does not mean that for a given realised interval calculated from sample data there is a 95% probability the population parameter lies within the interval, nor that there is a 95% probability that the interval covers the population parameter. Once an experiment is done and an interval calculated, this interval either covers the parameter value or it does not; it is no longer a matter of probability. The 95% probability relates to the reliability of the estimation procedure, not to a specific calculated interval.",

      "text": "Ohio and Iowa will be solid red in the next decade. The Southern East coast will be solid blue; NC/GA/SC, in that order. \n\nPA is a weird case; the west side of PA is turning solid red, but the east coast side is far more populous and will likely make the state stay purple, leaning blue. At best, it's a tossup state. \n\nGiven the direction that the GOP is taking, I have to think NH becomes solid blue in the next decade. That state is full of Libertarian-conservatives, and that's the opposite direction the GOP is heading. \n\nWI/MI/MN have the potential to start turning red. I give it 2 decades if we don't bring high value service jobs to the upper midwest; they're just barely hanging onto the stagnation of our loss of consumer manufacturing and need something to replace it. I'd say Illinois would be in the same boat if it weren't for Chicago being the powerhouse of the midwest turning that state solidly blue. \n\nNV I reckon turns solid blue along with CO. \n\n\nThe year we see Texas turn blue is the year the Republican party ends for good and splits apart, as the libertarians break off from the teapartiers/evangelicals, and the neocons flee to the Democrats. The Libertarian party will probably collapse at this point since their leadership is full of derp; the Former-Republican Libertarians will most likely form their own Libertarian-ish party and most of the former Libertarian party goes along to the new party. Republicans become a regional party in the bible belt and rust belt until they fade from significance in 5-10 years after the split. Probably even faster, as their sources of money dry up faster than a woman's vagina around Donald Trump. \n\nNeocons joining the Democrats has the potential to finally piss off the progressives enough to split off on their own, causing another ripple. The Republican-Libertarians at that point may make a play to lure and remaining Blue-Dog Democrats into their fold; may even compromise their libertarian principles to get the neocons back too. \n\nInteresting times ahead. We're looking at the end of the Sixth Party System here (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixth_Party_System). Who knows what's ahead now?",

Effective data analysts build logical processes that rely on insights derived from data.<br>3. Finding new insights involves trial and error, and data analysts need to have a rigorous problem-solving mindset.<br>4. Data analysts need to bridge the gap between the numbers and the real-world implications for the business.<br>5.

As a CAD person, I often would work with the mechanical engineer, the one who designed the AC and heating systems for a building along with hot and cold-water plumbing. Is this what you earned a degree in or would it be more like gearing, metal fabrication and such. In my case, I drafted engineers&#39; drawings for electrical and lighting but would draft for the &#39;mechanical&#39; designer. They would always have motors in their design to move air and water which puts a load on the electrical designs.",

I love organization and being able to be a detective of some sort to find the right data. For instance when I did Residential HVAC I would have to ask the customers questions for the symptoms of the system to build a case around for my diagnostics. The investigating part was very satisfying. Im definitely a big numbers nerd too and deal with data trends and such with DDC at my current company to find and diagnose issues with large commercial HVAC equipment. However I do love HVAC my research is showing a much higher wage for data analytics and less physical stress as well as being able to still be satisfied with problem solving. Luckily my healthcare company offers free tuition for college courses that include data analytics. I will definitely be taking advantage of this while I can!",

He highlights the six questions you need to ask yourself before starting a career in data analytics. These questions are:<br><br>1. Are you naturally curious and inquisitive?<br>2. Do you have an analytical mindset and a logical approach to your work?<br>3. Are you a keen problem solver?<br>4. Are you interested in business strategy?<br>5. Do you have an affinity for numbers and statistics?<br>6. Are you comfortable presenting and collaborating?<br><br>He explains that data analytics is about trying to find insights from data and requires you to be comfortable with working in uncertainty and admitting that you don&#39;t know where you need to go. You will also make a lot of mistakes, so you need to be confident in your ability to solve something despite having failed at it several times before.",

      "text": "This reminds me how I was fired from my last job:\n\nI was an assistant manager at an hotel. The manager had taken around 2 weeks off to get married, back at their home-country. All this was planned a year before - so I was ready to take responsibility as the acting manager. \n\nAnyway, the day the manager leaves, the boss decides to make a surprise visit. Yeey! He is not only a really hard guy to work with - incredibly undeserved ego, totally unprofessional, clueless about hospitality and service industries, and has this twisted idea of running an hotel like his textile factory. \n\nWe accept the reality, don't get idealist ambitions to teach him about the industry's necessities, and try to keep the place in one piece while also keeping him happy. But whatever happens, whenever he decides to visit us, a shit storm starts, around 2 - 3 people get fired and \"*necessary systematic changes*\" are made...\n\nThis time was even worse. There was a tension among the entire staff. People were whispering in the corners, walking around with their heads down, avoiding eye contact from each other. I knew some of the staff were also lobbying with the boss to secure their positions and have people \"they didn't like\" get fired. \n\nSo I'm not only left with keeping the hotel in one piece in its daily schedule, but also have to manage the personnel in this shitstorm and comply with the funny requests coming from the boss. I stay professional, mind my own business, try to stay away from all the chaos, lobbying and gossiping going around, while keeping my eyes open to see what's going on.\n\nI was already alarmed. This guy had replaced the entire management staff, 4 times in the 1 year the hotel had been running before us. But what skyrocketed my alertness level was when he decided to have a personnel meeting, without including me and another management level colleague. We weren't supposed to learn about this, but knowing about stuff was part of my job. \n\nBTW, I was a foreigner in the country like the manager. We had moved to the country only for the job. Also, the manager's marriage decision was kind of rushed because of the situation - something I wouldn't do, and didn't do: which later cost me a relationship of 6 years - a relationship I really valued. Anyway, my girlfriend came to visit me every 2 or 3 months. And (my luck) she had decided to come during these days. I had to stay at the hotel, work almost 24 hours without sleeping, only was able to rest my eyes in an empty room once in a while, and this was going on for 3 or 4 days. And out of respect to her, I had placed my now ex to one of the rooms instead of my house, so that I would be able to spare some time for her. \n\nAfter the huge meeting ended, we heard that the boss was also planning to have face to face meetings with each one of the personnel, including me and my management level colleague. So - during all these meetings, the hotel and completely stopped functioning. something you can rarely see. the guests are still in the rooms, r coming by to see an empty reception - or me at the reception.\n\nI said fuck it - went out for 30 minutes to reorganize my head and take my gf away from the situation. Had a coffee with her. Ranted for 30 minutes. Took some breaths, sent her to my apartment telling her I'd probably bring her stuff later in the day, and ran back to the battlefield. \n\nIn a few moments, I am summoned for the face to face meeting. Finally, some management level talk time, and receive the update on the situation I needed to have days ago. I wasn't expecting anything good, but trying to operate the place while completely in the dark, was getting harder and harder. \n\nI meet him, keep my professional face in every moment, don't even blink my eyes. He asks for some reports on this, reports on that. I give him the reports. He rants about the report format, tells us he had warned us many times before about the format, and for this reason he wont be working with the manager anymore. (I mean, come on, if you're gonna show off like a sadistic egomaniac, don't hide behind simple reasons. Just tell me you're sacking him, while he is away for getting married, just to satisfy your ego, and show me how big of a man you are too...)\n\nIt was expected. But I never imagined the style would get so ugly. Still, somehow managed to keep my professionalism, and said \"ok, I understand your position even if I wouldn't agree with the decision. And it wont be a problem for me. now on to the other xyz problem we were talking about.\" (I was loyal to my manager as fuck, but had nothing to do about it anymore, besides informing him about the situation asap - and had no ambitions of taking his place - would simply reject if I was offered.)  \n\nSo, we talk about some companies we are working with. For some reason he says: *\"they don't want invoices\"*. I had 2 invoices prepared for them 5 days ago. He was right, but the thing he didn't know was that the companies had changed their stance on the invoices 2 months ago. I explained him. He tells me - *\"this is my hotel,  do you think you'll know more than I do about how this place works\"* (last time he came was around 4 months ago). Then rants for a while. I insist. Request 5 minutes from him to bring the invoices as proof - and he starts screaming: *\"who the fuck you think you are, I won't be working with you too. You can stay at the hotel as long as you need.\"* \n\n*\"I wont be needing, I've rented an apartment here and am staying there ever since I came. Thanks for the offer though. I'll collect my stuff, pass the financial and other necessary keys etc. to someone you'll designate.\"\n\n\"The accountant\" (The accountant was stealing from the hotel, and was trying to team up with the f&b manager to grow the operation and steal from the restaurant too. We had been investigating the rumors for a while, and had some second degree proof about it. They had found a hole in the IT system we were using. We were also trying to change or fix it asap - to prevent other problems: but *\"investing in IT was financially unnecessary\"*) \n\n\"ok.\" ;) (After almost 72 hours without a decent sleep, lots of pressure on me, and seeing how much of a fucktard some people can be, I'm still surprised how I managed to keep my cool and professionalism, and was still able to think straight.)\n\nLater I learned, he also put a lot of time to spread rumors about me & the manager around in the city. \n\nI'm still living in the same city, managing a smaller hotel. I do my best to let people know about the unbiased story of how that manager was sent. And that hotel has replaced management 4 times after us - and is building a name for itself.\n\nI saw him a few months ago. he was surprised to see me in the city. Asked someone next to him what the hell I was doing. I had one of the most satisfied grins in my life when I saw his frustrated red face after he realized that \"all this power he thought he had to destroy me in the city\" - was nothing. \n\n-----------------------------------\n\nTLDR: Got fired.",

      "text": "The real problem here isn't what they're charging, it's why.  You are paying for speed, not amount of data.  The amount of data you use is meaningless to customer impact.  Their claim for needing to charge for high data usage is that \"those who use more data slow down the internet for those that don't\".  When in reality, the real reason people are impacting each others' internet speeds is that the provider has typically oversold all of their lines.  For example, if their line is capable of 5000mbps (random speed i pulled out of my ass), they will sell 50mbps speeds to 1000 homes.  They do this in hopes that not everyone is on and using bandwidth at the same time.  If you are sold as a single household on 50mbps internet, you aren't able to exceed that cap no matter what form of traffic you are using.  So you could be streaming high-def video once a year, if that happens to fall during a high usage time on an oversold line....people slow down.  So, as you can see, the bandwidth capability of what they are selling is the problem.  The data size cap is a completely arbitrary number they are pulling out of their ass to target consistent users.  Instead of actually being consumer oriented and expanding to prepare for/usher in future technology growth, they're doing things like lobbying for ending net neutrality and charging more for specific services.  In truth, ISP services have a high percentage of profitability because they're charging for lines that are already in existence that they rarely need to maintain.  To actually expand and be able to support their sales would be the \"customer oriented\" move but they are digging their heels in and doing everything in their power to avoid this cost.  The sad part is our government is run by money instead of public voice so we, as consumers, will likely lose this war.  \n\nTL:DR Speed does not equal Amount...they're charging you for the wrong thing.",

Feel free to copy and change it some:\n\nI do not currently have comcast; however, I saw several news articles about new 300 gig per month data caps in certain markets. We are all aware of the extortion comcast pulled against Netflix peering, and this latest move further limits users from enjoying HD online content.  Mathematically if you just watch HD content online and use your Internet for nothing else you get about 3.5 hours a day of content before you go over the cap.   We all know we use Internet for more than just viewing HD videos which brings our usage down even more. This is nothing but a play by comcast to limits users experience and force their hands to either subscribing to their TV service or paying more for service they currently receive. By the same token they should provide refunds for people they don't hit 300 gigs per month, but we don't see that happening. It's shameful that users do not have adequate broadband choices and are locked into poor companies like comcast. FCC it is your job to protect the end user and now is the time for action. This data caps has no impact on existing infrastructure,  it's just to increase profits at comcast. Please do something to stop this.",

Anyways I will make edits if I receive a response.\n\nComcast's price structure is unfair for people who are using less than 300 GB of \"data\" per month. The reason I believe this is true is because the people who are using more than 300 GB per month are forced into paying an extra $30, yet when it comes to let's say the elderly couple who only uses the internet to e-mail family and doesn't even come close to using 100 GB they are still paying the full price instead of receiving a reduced bill for using less of their service. Why is this contingency basis pricing only apply to people going over their data allowance and not the people using less data? Why won't they allow a rollover data plan such as AT&T introduced for their cell phone family plans? At the end of the day I do not agree in charging for the bytes of data that are used. Yet I know that it is unlikely that this will be changed any time soon. I am one of the people who are coming close to going over 300 GB so I choose not to try and changes things for myself, but to try and help the people who do not go over 300 GB. In conclusion I believe that there should be more regulations for companies who want to charge more contingent on whether or not someone uses more data and less. That if you are going to charge me more for using more than I've been given I believe that they should be forced to charge less to the people who are using less.",

      "text": "What would you do if you permanently lost all the photos, notes and other files on your phone?\n\nIf you have a backup system in place, you‚Äôd likely know what to do next: Restore it all to a new phone. But if you haven‚Äôt thought about it, fear not: The backup process has become so simplified that it takes just a few screen taps. Here‚Äôs a quick overview of some ways you can keep your files safe, secure and up to date.\nGetting Started\n\nWhen you first set up your phone, you created (or logged into) a free account from Apple, Google or Samsung to use the company‚Äôs software and services. For example, this would be the Apple ID on your iPhone, the Google Account on your Android phone or the Samsung Account on your Galaxy device.\nImage\nThe iPhone, left, or Android settings display how much storage space you are using with your account.Credit...Apple; Google\n\nWith that account, you probably had five gigabytes of free iCloud storage space from Apple, or 15 gigabytes of online storage from Google and Samsung. This server space is used as an encrypted digital locker for your phone‚Äôs backup app, but it can fill up quickly ‚Äî especially if you have other devices connected to your account and storing files there.\nImage\nIf you start getting messages about running out of online storage space for your backups, tap the upgrade option to buy more on a monthly or yearly payment schedule.Credit...Apple; Google\n\nWhen you get close to your storage limit, you‚Äôll get warnings ‚Äî along with an offer to sign up for more server space for a monthly fee, usually a few dollars for at least another 100 gigabytes. (Note that Samsung‚Äôs Temporary Cloud Backup tool supplies an unlimited amount of storage for 30 days if your Galaxy is in the repair shop or ready for an upgrade.)\n\nBut online backup is just one approach. You can keep your files on a local drive instead with a few extra steps.\nBacking Up\n\nApple, Google and Samsung all have specific setup instructions for cloud backup in the support area of their sites. But the feature is easily located.\n\nOn an iPhone, tap your name at the top of the Settings screen and then tap iCloud. On many Android phones, tap System and then Backup. Here, you set the phone to back up automatically (which usually happens when it‚Äôs connected to a Wi-Fi network and plugged into its charger), or opt for a manual backup that starts when you tap the button.\nImage\nTo get to your backup options, open your phone's settings app. On an iPhone, left, tap your account name at the top to get to the iCloud backup and sync settings. For a Google Pixel and some other Android phones, tap System on the settings screen to get to the backup options.Credit...Apple; Google\n\nBackup apps usually save a copy of your call history, phone settings, messages, photos, videos and data from apps. Content you can freely download, like the apps themselves, are not typically backed up since they‚Äôre easy to grab again.\nImage\nIf you don‚Äôt want to back up your phone online, you can back up its contents to your computer with a USB cable or other connection; the steps vary based on the phone and computer involved.Credit...Apple\n\nIf you don‚Äôt want your files on a remote server, you can park your phone‚Äôs backup on your computer‚Äôs hard drive. Steps vary based on the hardware, but Apple‚Äôs support site has a guide for backing up an iPhone to a Windows PC or a Mac using a USB cable.\n\nGoogle‚Äôs site has instructions for manually transferring files between an Android phone and a computer, and Samsung‚Äôs Smart Switch app assists with moving content between a Galaxy phone and a computer.\nSync vs. Backup\n\nSynchronizing your files is not the same as backing them up. A backup saves file copies at a certain point in time. Syncing your smartphone keeps information in certain apps, like contacts and calendars, current across multiple devices. When synchronized, your phone, computer and anything else logged into your account have the same information ‚Äî like that to-do list you just updated.\nImage\nYou can adjust which apps synchronize with other devices in the Android, left, and iOS settings.Credit...Google; Apple\n\nWith synchronization, when you delete an item somewhere, it disappears everywhere. A backup stays intact in its storage location until updated in the next backup.\n\nBy default, Google syncs the content of its own mobile and web apps between phone, computer and tablet. In the Google Account Data settings, you can adjust which apps sync. Samsung Cloud has similar options for its Galaxy devices.\n\nApple handles data synchronization across its devices through its iCloud service. You can set which apps you want to sync in your iCloud account settings.\nOther Options\n\nYou don‚Äôt have to use the backup tools that came with your phone. Third-party apps for online backup ‚Äî like iDrive or iBackup ‚Äî are available by subscription. If you prefer to keep your iPhone backups on the computer, software like iMazing for Mac or Windows ($60) or AltTunes for Windows ($35 a year) are alternatives. Droid Transfer for Windows ($35) is among the Android backup offerings.\nImage\nIf you‚Äôd prefer to use a third-party backup app, you have several to choose from, including iDrive.Credit...iDrive\n\nIf losing your camera roll is your biggest nightmare, Google Photos, iCloud Photos and other services like Amazon Photos and Dropbox can be set to automatically back up all your pictures and keep them in sync across your connected devices.\nImage\nDropbox can back up your photos and videos when you connect the phone to the computer, left, or directly from your camera roll if you have Dropbox installed.Credit...Dropbox\n\nNo matter the method you choose, having a backup takes some pain out of a lost, stolen or broken phone. Some photos and files can never be replaced, and restoring your iPhone‚Äôs or Android phone‚Äôs content from a backup is a lot easier than starting over.",

      "text": "Thanks for asking! Here are a few of the risks that we're working on:\n\nYou can lose the card or your phone. Because you do not know the keys to the asset (they're encrypted in the Phonon) that means you lost your money, just like if you lose your wallet and the cash inside it. There are ways to mitigate this, for example a slow claim process for assets that support a smart contract. This would be a bond-challenge-response-confirm-receive kind of approach. Malicious actors could try to take the asset but the real owner could take their bond by signing the smart contract with the phonon.\n\nThe hardware can fail. These non-volatile chips are good for thousands of read-write cycles but if they fail you lose whatever's on the card. This can also be mitigated by the same slow-claim process described above.\n\nIn terms of the asset on the phonon, a malicious actor could create a clone of a blockchain, e.g. a copy of Ethereum, and create a phonon using this fake blockchain. Your card would not be able to tell the difference without doing a quick (free) query of the Ethereum blockchain that \\*you\\* know is real. So this requires an internet connection. There's a way to setup what we call \"attestation\" of phonons with a TTP (trusted third party) that would create a means of trading asset-based phonons offline. This is all really early still and conceptual.\n\nThe cards rely on a Certificate Authority because otherwise someone could create a card with a fake-PUF and pretend they have a phonon when in fact they do not (meaning they can know the private key of the asset and perform a double-spend attack). The CA would post a bond to their published list of certificates for each card, verifying that the cards are indeed phonon cards. Each Phonon card or eSIM would then be certified and part of the published list (verified by cryptographic hashes). With the right setup a robust security profile is achievable and because Phonon is entirely Peer-to-Peer (P2P) a single attack on e.g. the CA list, meaning a fraudulent certificate, can be identified quickly and early, preventing a systemic failure of the entire system.\n\nThese are the big ones. I won't try to sugarcoat it, they sound like big hurdles. And they are big. But they have solutions as far as I can tell (again, not an expert on this stuff, just a layperson who has spent a lot of time with it).",

And yes, 5G is likely to make networking be significantly more expensive and also be the reason why [Qualcomm's new chipsets are more expensive](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/03/reports-google-lg-dont-want-qualcomms-super-expensive-snapdragon-865/), but take this with a grain of salt (main reason is more likely just the immense growth in data).\n\nHonestly I'm still fine with that and I'm happy with my 4G and Wifi, but open for awesome technology made possible through 5G. I'm **not** really concerned for any health issues, but I'm just curious as to why there is such an extreme rush. It's curious that the company installing communications networks that will be used by governments, doctors, research labs etc. is also banned by the US, Australia, Japan, etc.\n\nIt's always a balance with new technology.

There are many people with a screen time average in excess of [7 hours a day](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/10/29/health/common-sense-kids-media-use-report-wellness/index.html); I'm much more concerned about internet addiction/depression than a hypothetical 0.0000001% increase in cancer if at all. 4G took us from texting a bit every day (3G) to watching hours and hours of video in a single sitting ~~(apparently there are many countries where unlimited data is not common).~~",

      "text": "WSJ article Per Requests Below:\n\nMissing Airplane Flew On for Hours\nEngine Data Suggest Malaysia Flight Was Airborne Long After Radar Disappearance, U.S. Investigators Say\n\nBy ANDY PASZTOR\nUpdated March 13, 2014 12:30 a.m. ET\nU.S. investigators suspect that Malaysia Airlines 3786.KU -2.04%  Flight 370 stayed in the air for about four hours past the time it reached its last confirmed location, according to two people familiar with the details, raising the possibility that the plane could have flown on for hundreds of additional miles under conditions that remain murky.\n\nAviation investigators and national security officials believe the plane flew for a total of five hours based on data automatically downloaded and sent to the ground from the Boeing Co. BA -0.99%  777's engines as part of a routine maintenance and monitoring program.\n\nThat raises a host of new questions and possibilities about what happened aboard the widebody jet carrying 239 people, which vanished from civilian air-traffic control radar over the weekend, about one hour into a flight to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur.\n\nSix days after the mysterious disappearance prompted a massive international air and water search that so far hasn't produced any results, the investigation appears to be broadening in scope.\n\nU.S. counterterrorism officials are pursuing the possibility that a pilot or someone else on board the plane may have diverted it toward an undisclosed location after intentionally turning off the jetliner's transponders to avoid radar detection, according to one person tracking the probe.\n\nThe investigation remains fluid, and it isn't clear whether investigators have evidence indicating possible terrorism or espionage. So far, U.S. national security officials have said that nothing specifically points toward terrorism, though they haven't ruled it out.\n\nBut the huge uncertainty about where the plane was headed, and why it continued flying so long without working transponders, has raised theories among investigators that the aircraft may have been commandeered for a reason that appears unclear to U.S. authorities. Some of those theories have been laid out to national security officials and senior personnel from various U.S. agencies, according to one person familiar with the matter.\n\nAt one briefing, according to this person, officials were told investigators are actively pursuing the notion that the plane was diverted \"with the intention of using it later for another purpose.\"\n\nAs of Wednesday it remained unclear whether the plane reached an alternate destination or if it ultimately crashed, potentially hundreds of miles from where an international search effort has been focused.\n\nIn those scenarios, neither mechanical problems, pilot mistakes nor some other type of catastrophic incident caused the 250-ton plane to mysteriously vanish from radar.\n\nThe latest revelations come as local media reported that Malaysian police visited the home of at least one of the two pilots.\n\nBoeing officials and a Malaysia Airlines official declined to comment.\n\nThe engines' onboard monitoring system is provided by their manufacturer, Rolls-Royce RR.LN -1.71%  PLC, and it periodically sends bursts of data about engine health, operations and aircraft movements to facilities on the ground.\n\nRolls-Royce couldn't immediately be reached for comment.\n\nAs part of its maintenance agreements, Malaysia Airlines transmits its engine data live to Rolls-Royce for analysis. The system compiles data from inside the 777's two Trent 800 engines and transmits snapshots of performance, as well as the altitude and speed of the jet.\n\nThose snippets are compiled and transmitted in 30-minute increments, said one person familiar with the system. According to Rolls-Royce's website, the data is processed automatically \"so that subtle changes in condition from one flight to another can be detected.\"\n\nThe engine data is being analyzed to help determine the flight path of the plane after the transponders stopped working. The jet was originally headed for China, and its last verified position was half way across the Gulf of Thailand.\n\nA total flight time of five hours after departing Kuala Lumpur means the Boeing 777 could have continued for an additional distance of about 2,200 nautical miles, reaching points as far as the Indian Ocean, the border of Pakistan or even the Arabian Sea, based on the jet's cruising speed.",

      "text": "Communication satellites received intermittent data \"pings\" from a missing Malaysia Airlines 3786.KU -4.08% jet, giving the plane's location, speed and altitude for at least five hours after it disappeared from civilian radar screens, people briefed on the investigation said Thursday.\n\nThe final satellite ping was sent from over water, at what one of these people called a \"normal\" cruising altitude. The people declined to say where specifically the transmission originated, adding that it was unclear why the transmissions stopped. One possibility one person cited was that the system sending them had been disabled by someone on board.\n\nThe automatic pings, or attempts to link up with satellites operated by Inmarsat ISAT.LN -1.32% PLC, occurred a number of times after Malaysia Airlines Flight 370's last verified position, these people said, indicating that at least through those hours, the Boeing Co. BA -2.04% 777 carrying 239 people remained intact and hadn't been destroyed in a crash, act of sabotage or explosion.\n\nMalaysian Airlines said it hadn't received any such data.\n\nChicago-based Boeing declined to comment Thursday.\n\nIf the plane remained airborne for that entire period it could have flown more than 2,200 nautical miles from its last confirmed position over the Gulf of Thailand, these people said.\n\nOn Thursday, meanwhile, the international search for the plane zeroed in on areas far west of the plane's last known location.\n\nCmdr. William Marks, the spokesman for the U.S. Seventh Fleet, said the USS Kidd would move through the Strait of Malacca, on Malaysia's west coast, and stay at its northwest entrance, while surveillance planes would search an area of the Indian Ocean 1,000 miles or more west of the strait.\n\nMalaysia, which is overseeing the search effort, directed Indian forces to a specific set of coordinate in the Andaman Sea, northwest of the Malay peninsula, an Indian official said Thursday.\n\n\"There was no specified rationale behind looking in those areas, but a detailed list was provided late Wednesday evening,\" the Indian official said.\n\nU.S. aviation investigators said they were analyzing the satellite transmissions to determine whether they can glean information about the plane's location or status. The transmissions were sent via onboard technology designed to send routine maintenance and system-monitoring data back to the ground via satellite links, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nA woman in Kuala Lumpur writes a message with others expressing prayers and well-wishes for the missing jet. Agence France-Presse/Getty Images\n\nAmong the possible scenarios investigators said they are now considering is whether the jet may have landed at any point during the five-hour period under scrutiny, or whether it ultimately crashed.\n\nThe people said aviation investigators are exploring the possibility that someone on the plane may have intentionally disabled two other automated communication systems in an attempt to avoid detection. One system is the transponders, which transmit to ground radar stations information on the plane's identity, location and altitude, and another system that collects and transmits data about several of the plane's key systems.\n\nThe widebody jet was scheduled to fly overnight to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur in the predawn hours of March 8. Its transponders last communicated with Malaysian civilian radar about an hour after takeoff.\nRelated\n\nAfter the plane dropped off civilian radar screens, these people said, the satellite link operated in a kind of standby mode for several hours and sought to establish contact with a satellite or satellites. These transmissions didn't include data about any of the plane's critical systems, they said, but the periodic contacts indicate to investigators that the plane was still intact and believed to be flying at least a significant portion of that time. The people said the transmissions included detailed information about the plane's location, speed and bearing.\n\nThe transmissions, one person said, were comparable to the plane \"saying I'm here, I'm ready to send data.\"\n\nUnknown so far to investigators is what happened to the plane following the final satellite ping, these people said. Questions remain about the plane's status, including what was happening in the cockpit.\n\nFormer FBI agent Chris Voss joins the News Hub to discuss U.S. investigators' suspicions that Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 stayed in the air for four hours after vanishing from civilian air-traffic control radar.\n\nBut the huge uncertainty about where the plane was headed, and why it apparently continued flying so long without working transponders and other communication links, has raised theories among investigators that the aircraft may have been commandeered for reasons that remain unclear to U.S. authorities.\n\nAt one briefing, according to this person, officials were told that investigators are actively pursuing the notion that the plane was diverted \"with the intention of using it later for another purpose.\"\n\nAs authorities scramble to analyze and understand all of the transmissions from the missing 777, the situation continues to change rapidly. Some people briefed on the issue initially described the transmissions as information that had been relayed from onboard monitoring systems embedded in the two Rolls-Royce PLC Trent 800 engines, not the idling satellite communications system.\n\n‚ÄîTrefor Moss, Gaurav Raghuvanshi, Josh Chin and Jeremy Page contributed to this article..\n\nWrite to Andy Pasztor at andy.pasztor@wsj.com and Jon Ostrower at jon.ostrower@wsj.com",

      "text": "Full text of Malaysian press conference\n\nIntroductory statement \n\n\nThe search for MH370 continues. Over the past few days, new leads from satellite data have focused \nour search and rescue operations in the southern corridor. Our partners continue to deploy assets to \nassist us, as we work to narrow the search areas. \n\n\n\\1. Operational update \n\n\nYesterday, 18,500 square nautical miles were searched in the Australian search area.   \nTwo orange objects approximately one metre in length and one white coloured drum were sighted \nby search aircraft, but remain unidentified and have not been conclusively linked to MH370.   \nHMAS Success detected two radar targets within the search area, but could not locate the targets on \nfurther investigation of the area.   \nEarlier today, a Chinese search plane reportedly sighted objects in the Australian search area. These \nobjects are not in the vicinity of those which were identified by the Australian authorities last week.   \nA few minutes ago the Prime Minister received a call from the Prime Minister of Australia, who \ninformed him that an Australian search aircraft had located two objects in the Australian search \narea, one circular and one rectangular.   \nHMAS Success is in the vicinity and it is possible that the objects could be received within the next \nfew hours, or by tomorrow morning at the latest.   \nThree search areas, totalling approximately 20,000 square nautical miles, have been identified for \noperations today. RCC Australia anticipates that 10 aircraft will be used.   \nHMAS Success remains the only vessel in the search area. A number of Chinese vessels are expected \nto commence arriving within the search area on 25th March.   \n3 aircraft - 2 from Japan and 1 from the UAE ‚Äì have already departed from Subang today and are en \nroute to the southern corridor.   \n6 Malaysian ships, with 3 ship-borne helicopters, are now in northern part of the southern corridor.   \n10 Chinese ships are in the southern corridor, carrying out search and rescue operations. HMS Echo \nis currently refuelling in the Maldives and will be sailing to the southern corridor this evening.   \nIn the northern corridor, Turkmenistan have confirmed they have not had any sightings of MH370 on \ntheir radar. Each piece of information we receive from our partners in the northern corridor helps us \nto continuously narrow the corridor. \n\n\\2. Satellite images \n\n\nNew leads into MH370‚Äôs possible location have come from satellite data. This was one of the four \ntools we identified that could narrow the search area, along with surveillance radar data, increasing \nsurface and air assets, and bringing in more technical experts.   \nThe most recent images were obtained by French satellites, which captured radar images of \npotential objects in the vicinity of the southern corridor on 21st\n March.  \nThese images were received by Malaysia on the evening of the 22nd March, and were relayed to RCC Australia on the morning of the 23rd March, as they are leading the search in that particular area of the southern corridor.   \nThis morning we have received a further set of images from French satellites, this time captured by \ncameras. These images were taken yesterday and have been relayed to RCC Australia.   \n\n\\3. Family briefings \n\nYesterday, the high-level team met with families in Beijing for more than eight hours. \nThe families asked many questions, and made detailed requests for radar readings and other data.   \nSome of these questions could not be answered, and some of the data they requested was still being \nheld by the investigation, as is standard procedure in investigations of this sort.   \nAfter meeting with the families for a total of more than twelve hours, and taking hundreds of \nquestions, the high-level team has returned to Kuala Lumpur to discuss the matters raised at the \nmeetings. They will return to Beijing tomorrow to continue.   \nThe briefings in Kuala Lumpur over the last two days went smoothly, and the families responded as \npositively as could be expected, with the families engaging with representatives from the relevant \nauthorities.   \nIt has always been our intention to keep the families as fully informed as possible. We continue to \ndo so.   \n\n\\4. Specific questions \n\nThere are a few specific questions I would like to respond to.   \nOn the police investigation, we can confirm that the police have interviewed more than a hundred \npeople, including families of both the pilot and co-pilot.   \nAs far as the transcript is concerned, the technical committee is considering releasing it and we will \nkeep you informed about the decision.   \nThe Inspector General of the Police will attend tomorrow‚Äôs press conference to answer further \nquestions on the investigation.   \nWe can also confirm that MH370 was carrying wooden pallets. However, there is as yet no evidence \nthat these are related to the wooden pallets reportedly sighted in the Australian search area. \n\n\\5. Concluding remarks \n\nThe search for MH370 has taken us halfway around the world. At the moment there are new leads, \nbut nothing conclusive. Our thoughts continue to be with the families who are still waiting for news.   \nIn the meantime, we are grateful for the on-going co-operation shown by our partners in this \nmultinational search.",

As you will hear in the next hour from Malaysia's Prime Minister, we must now accept all evidence suggests the plane went down in the Southern Indian Ocean.\"\n\nThe press conference was a departure from the normal routine which saw one press conference held per day.

The first was to announce the plane's movements had been determined to be deliberate.\n\nOn Monday afternoon a Chinese Ilyushin Il-76 spotted what may have been debris from MH370 on its return to Perth. These objects were unable to be located again, but several hours later a Royal Australian Air Force P3 Orion spotted different debris.\n\nPhotographs were taken during both sightings, with analysis expected to be made public today.\n\nUS agencies have previously announced they will move a black-box locator into the area once there is an idea where the majority of the debris is located.",

Using a type of analysis never before used in an investigation of this sort, they have been able to shed more light on MH370‚Äôs flight path.\n\nBased on their new analysis, Inmarsat and the AAIB have concluded that MH370 flew along the southern corridor, and that its last position was in the middle of the Indian Ocean, west of Perth.\n \nThis is a remote location, far from any possible landing sites. It is therefore with deep sadness and regret that I must inform you that, according to this new data, flight MH370 ended in the southern Indian Ocean.\n\nWe will be holding a press conference tomorrow with further details. In the meantime, we wanted to inform you of this new development at the earliest opportunity. We share this information out of a commitment to openness and respect for the families, two principles which have guided this investigation.\n \nMalaysia Airlines have already spoken to the families of the passengers and crew to inform them of this development.

The 2:11 ping would have coincided roughly with the last military radar trace at Pulau Perak island at 2:15. So, draw an arc at that point - all your subsequent arcs must be further away from the satellite than that. Of course that doesn't mean that MH370 immediately started flying further away from the satellite as from 2:11, it could have still been flying towards the satellite, but by the time it got to 3:11 it had to be further away than it was at 2:11. See what you come up with...",

      "text": "*Note: Formatting's mine to aid readability*\n\n**INFORMATION PROVIDED TO MH370 INVESTIGATION BY UK AIR ACCIDENTS INVESTIGATION BRANCH (AAIB)** \n\n**25/03/14**\n\nOn 13 March we received information from UK satellite company Inmarsat indicating that routine automatic communications between one of its satellites and the aircraft could be used to determine several possible flight paths.\n\nInmarsat UK has continued to refine this analysis and yesterday the AAIB presented its most recent findings, which indicate that the aircraft flew along the southern corridor.\n\nAs you have heard, an aircraft is able to communicate with ground stations via satellite.\n\nIf the ground station has not heard from an aircraft for an hour it will transmit a 'log on / log off' message, sometimes referred to as a ‚Äòping‚Äô, using the aircraft‚Äôs unique identifier. If the aircraft receives its unique identifier it returns a short message indicating that it is still logged on. This process has been described as a ‚Äúhandshake‚Äù and takes place automatically.\n\nFrom the ground station log it was established that after ACARS stopped sending messages, 6 complete handshakes took place.\n\nThe position of the satellite is known, and the time that it takes the signal to be sent and received, via the satellite, to the ground station can be used to establish the range of the aircraft from the satellite. This information was used to generate arcs of possible positions from which the Northern and Southern corridors were established.\n\n**Refined analysis from Inmarsat**\n\nIn recent days Inmarsat developed a second innovative technique which considers the velocity of the aircraft relative to the satellite. Depending on this relative movement, the frequency received and transmitted will differ from its normal value, in much the same way that the sound of a passing car changes as it approaches and passes by. This is called the Doppler effect. The Inmarsat technique analyses the difference between the frequency that the ground station expects to receive and that actually measured. This difference is the result of the Doppler effect and is known as the Burst Frequency Offset.\n\nThe Burst Frequency Offset changes depending on the location of the aircraft on an arc of possible positions, its direction of travel, and its speed. In order to establish confidence in its theory, Inmarsat checked its predictions using information obtained from six other B777 aircraft flying on the same day in various directions. There was good agreement.\n\nWhile on the ground at Kuala Lumpur airport, and during the early stage of the flight, MH370 transmitted several messages. At this stage the location of the aircraft and the satellite were known, so it was possible to calculate system characteristics for the aircraft, satellite, and ground station.\n\nDuring the flight the ground station logged the transmitted and received pulse frequencies at each handshake. Knowing the system characteristics and position of the satellite it was possible, considering aircraft performance, to determine where on each arc the calculated burst frequency offset fit best.\n\nThe analysis showed poor correlation with the Northern corridor, but good correlation with the Southern corridor, and depending on the ground speed of the aircraft it was then possible to estimate positions at 0011 UTC, at which the last complete handshake took place. I must emphasise that this is not the final position of the aircraft.\n\nThere is evidence of a partial handshake between the aircraft and ground station at 0019 UTC. At this time this transmission is not understood and is subject to further ongoing work.\n\nNo response was received from the aircraft at 0115 UTC, when the ground earth station sent the next log on / log off message. This indicates that the aircraft was no longer logged on to the network.\n\nTherefore, some time between 0011 UTC and 0115 UTC the aircraft was no longer able to communicate with the ground station. This is consistent with the maximum endurance of the aircraft.\n\nThis analysis by Inmarsat forms the basis for further study to attempt to determine the final position of the aircraft. Accordingly, the Malaysian investigation has set up an international working group, comprising agencies with expertise in satellite communications and aircraft performance, to take this work forward.\n\nIn Annex I (attached) there are three diagrams, showing:\n\n**Doppler correction contributions** [Image](http://i.imgur.com/ZoONTm0.png) \n\nThis diagram shows the Doppler contributions to the burst frequency offset.\n\n**MH370 measured data against predicted tracks** [Image](http://i.imgur.com/dRThs5s.png)\n\nThe blue line is the burst frequency offset measured at the ground station for MH370.\n\nThe green line is the predicted burst frequency offset for the southern route, which over the last 6 handshakes show close correlation with the measured values for MH370.\n\nThe red line is the predicted burst frequency offset for the northern route, which over the last 6 handshakes does not correlate with the measured values for MH370.\n\n**Example southern tracks** [Image](http://i.imgur.com/SwRLcOD.png)\n\nThis shows the southern tracks for a ground speed of 400 and 450 knots ground speed. It should be noted that further work is required to determine the aircraft speed and final position.\n\nSource: [MOT Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=740971779281171&id=178566888854999)",

      "text": "Hi, yes sure happy to answer:  \n1) Conceptually it‚Äôs similar to Alandia, since it is peer-to-peer lending. The smart contracts will be built in the most updated version and more advanced, which will allow a larger composability with the entire ecosystem.   \nComposability will also come from the features we are going to develop. Each lender or borrower position could be tokenized and then traded or used in other protocols, with the goal of spreading this movement of value that tends to generate value by creating assets from properties already held by users. In addition, each user will have the ability to collateralize one or more fungible or non-fungible assets, be able to bid on multiple loan proposals, and request for a multiple asset loan.  \n\n\n2)  - BendDAO Lending: is a peer-to-pool protocol in the Ethereum blockchain had a maximum TVL of about $240M according to DeFI Lama  \n\\- NFTfi:  is a peer-2-peer protocol in the Ethereum blockchain had a maximum TVL of about $33M according to DeFI Lama, allows collateralizing NFT by borrowing wETH, DAI and USDC, loans have a fixed term and can be renegotiated  \n\\- FRAKT: on Solana's blockchain had a maximum TVL of about $10M according to DeFiLlama, offers both peer-2-peer and peer-2-pool loans.  \n\\- CENTRIFUGE:  is an open marketplace of real-world asset pools. Total assets financed $442M, mcap $108M according to Coingecko  \n\\- REALT:  provides investors with a simple, intelligent, and user-friendly method to buy into fractional, tokenized properties, leveraging the U.S. legal system and the permissionless nature of DeFi. TVL $91M according to DeFi Lama.  \n\n\n3)  We will develop a new auction contract leveraging the new features of Algorand in order to allow a more efficient and interoperable protocol. The code will be open source as the rest of the entire project.   \nWe want NFT marketplaces or RWA platforms to be able to take advantage of the auctions directly, so our plan is to allow them to run auctions on their website directly and parallel to Folks Finance so that the auction audience is cross pollinating multiple projects.  \n\n\n4) The project revenue is strongly related to the rest of the ecosystem. Folks finance does not tokenize RWA or mints NFTs. So in the long term, it will depend on the availability and demand of such assets. Nevertheless, it is crucially important that the infrastructure exists so that existing projects can take advantage of it and new projects can come and build on top of it.   \n\n\n5) It will be sold in batches to minimize price impact. Ideally, we would wait to commit it in liquid governance, and then sell the gAlgo on the DEXs but this depends on the funding timing as well.",

      "text": "I am not a lawyer but have an MSc in Electrical Engineering and have been helping out in some patent cases.  \n\nWhat you see above in the patent applications are just context for the reader. What is actually claimed is always at the bottom of the patent application, which in US patents begins with \"What is claimed is:\".  \n\nA US patent that ends with B2 means that it is examined and granted. In US the patent system allows you to sort of pre-apply for a patent and publish that application which functions as a placeholder patent until it gets narrowed down and examined. B2 is the narrowed down and 'final' version.  \n\nPatent claims come in two variations. Independent claims, which are standalone and the main juice of the patent application, and dependent claims which further specify the features you want to protect. **If an independent claim goes down, all the dependent claims go with it but if a dependent claim goes down the rest that were not dependant on it still stand.**  \n\nOften claims are used to claim unnecessary and not yet implemented features just in case.  \n\nComputer program patents are more convoluted than normal patents because in the US you cannot patent an algorithm or a program, only something physical can be patented. This is why the software patents are about the physical memory section holding the algorithm and the processor executing it and as a result things become long and confusing.  \n\n**TLDR:** One patent is about flying mounts, trying to carefully expand the coverage to ground and water mounts and for allowing the player to switch from one mount into a flying mount and the other is for player controlled and automatic pet battles. Nintendo has clearly constructed these just to draw out a legal fight as long as possible.  \n\n## Filtering out the obligatory linguistical maneuvers, the patent US 12,409,387 B2 is about virtual mounts and claims the following:\n\nClaim 1. A movable player character that can select a mount **from a captured virtual creature** and then move the player in air by moving the creature using movement input.\n\n- claim 2 expands this to ground and water mounts due to clever wording  \n\n- claim 3 is for falling/collision damage using a mount in claim 1  \n\n- claim 4 is for having 2 different visual representations for the mount of claim 1\n\n- claim 5 is a specific version of claim 4 for having a miniature model and an actual model as the two visual representations  \n\n- claim 6 is for changing the container model of claim 4 based on user selections  \n\n- claim 7 is for using a mount in claim 1 to also move on the ground  \n\n- claim 8 is for stopping the fall of the player with a mount in claim 1  \n\n- claim 9 is for obtaining the mount in claim 1 by battling or catching  \n\n- claim 10 is for having a selection image associated to mounts in claim 1  \n\n- claim 11 is for the player selecting a water/ground mount image (claim 10) but being forced on an air mount  \n\n- claim 12 is for using a display object to represent the air mount that is different from the selection image of claim 10  \n\nClaim 13. Claim 1 is on the storage memory section, this claim is exactly the same as claim 1 but instead on the 'information processing apparatus' that has one or more processors, a display and an interface to interact with.  \n\nClaim 14. The same as claim 13 and 1 but on a system having a memory and a processor.  \n\n- claim 15 is for player character of claim 14 moving with together with the mount  \n\n- claim 16 is for the player character riding the mount of claim 14  \n\n- claim 17 is for the player character being held by the mount of claim 14  \n\n- claim 18 is for the player character holding on to the mount of claim 14  \n\n- claim 19 is for having different kinds of mounts of claim 14  \n\n- claim 20 is for falling damage under claim 14  \n\nClaim 21. A claim on the method of allowing the player to switch from any mount to a flying mount by first causing a dismount and storing the non-flying mount due to any in-game interaction and then the player using an input action to pull out the flying mount.  \n\n- claim 22 is for switching from non-flying mounts to flying mounts in claim 21  \n\n- claim 23 is for having different types of mounts that can be used to switch into a flying mount in claim 21  \n\n## Doing the same to the patent US 12,403,397 B2 is about pet battles and claims the following:\n\n\nClaim 1. Summoning a pet, having a separate mode for the battle, automatically moving the summoned pet into the correct position for the battle and having an auto-battle mode where the pet and the enemy will battle it out without player input.  \n\n- claim 2 is for the computer to control the pet automatically after the auto-battle mode of claim 1 ends  \n\n- claim 3 is for automatically starting a new auto-battle after the fight ends as in claim 2 based on the range between the pet and a new enemy  \n\n- claim 4 is for specifically allowing the pet to follow the player for the AI pathing in claim 3  \n\n- claim 5 is for allowing the player to make an input such that the pet in claim 1 will disappear from the field  \n\n- claim 6 is for allowing a player controlled battle to happen when the player character touches an enemy regardless if the pet of claim 1 is out or not (traditional pokemon encounter)  \n\n- claim 7 is for moving the pet into a pre-defined formation when the player inputs an action \n\n- claim 8 is for doing claim 7 and pulling the pet out when it was not out before the player inputs the formation action. \n\n- claim 9 is for selecting an enemy and then selecting if you want to do player controlled or auto-battle as in claim 1, on player controlled battle the summoned pet will appear at the enemy and on auto-battles the pet will be moved to the enemy  \n\n- claim 10 is for having attacks and capture option in pet battles with corresponding animations for the player and/or the pet of claim 1  \n\n- claim 11 is for changing the camera view in the event of a player controlled pet battle in claim 10 without switching the scene (battle happens in place) to make a cinematic battle view with limited player movements  \n\n- claim 12 is for allowing the player to move during auto-battle versions of claim 11  \n\nClaim 13. Again, it is the same as claim 1 but on an information processing apparatus containing at least one processor instead of claiming the storage section of the memory  \n\n- claims 14-24 are exactly the same as claims 2-12 but dependant on the claim 13 instead of 1  \n\nClaim 25. Same as 13 and 1 but on a system with a single processor  \n\nClaim 26. The method of having player controlled and automatically performed pet battles in the game\n\n## So with that being said, what do we notice from these?  \n\nFirst of all, I believe we can all agree the examinator was not familiar with video games as many mundane stuff got through to the final version.  \n\nHowever we can also clearly see Nintendo knows many of these are not going to hold. See for example how the \"method\" claims do not have many dependent claims under them as they are expected to be the first to fall.  \n\nClaiming the same stuff over and over again on different physical setups clearly should tell us that these patent claims are nothing more than an attempt to lock Pocketpair in a long legal battle where they have to tear down each of the claims. Nintendo is obviously hoping they don't have the finances to do it.  \n\nThat is all there is to these patents. It is a targeted financial pressure tool against a single competitor that is not expected to hold in court but with a hope of causing too much financial damage to the smaller competitor.",

      "text": "Yes, I admit, this Nvidia trade was pure luck.  I don‚Äôt have any clue what I‚Äôm doing.  That said, according to my fidelity reports, I have beat the market every year for the last 10 years.  I don‚Äôt think beating the market is hard lately as long as you buy tech stocks and I‚Äôm sure Nvidia and Tesla have helped me beat it.  \n\nOkay to answer your other question, I‚Äôve had 2 really bad opportunities pass me by when it comes to purchasing a house that appreciated quickly.  I‚Äôll share the worst on here.  \n\nI rented a house in PR for 3 years that the owner offered me to buy for $1.2m.  I said no because that‚Äôs a lot of money and I knew all the weird issues of the house because I was living in it.  Then covid happened and she got the house appraised and it wound up selling for $1.7m when everyone started migrating to Puerto Rico from the US. Unfortunately our rental agent didn‚Äôt put a first right of refusal in our contract so I couldn‚Äôt lock in the price and keep the listing from going to the public market.  \n\nI became friends with the new owner and 2 years later he sold it for $3.5m after putting about $600k into it (solar panels, renovated some storage rooms, painted the house, etc etc).  So he made $1.2m tax free by living in a 5,000 sqft house for 2 years ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è If I had just done the same thing and bought the house from the owner when she offered it to me for $1.2, I would have made $1.7m in 3-4 years with minimal work.  It‚Äôs the worse financial decision I‚Äôve ever made.  \n\nOkay now for my best financial decision.  I was working a crappy day job in retail in 2010 but wanted to buy a house because my rent was the same as a mortgage. I found pretty large house, 4,500 sqft, for $335,000 and it was just outside the developed part of a fairly popular US vacation town.  I bought at the absolute bottom of the housing market so that part was luck for sure. As I mentioned, I was making $12 an hour wage but had been buying Apple stock for a few years and used that as down payment for 20% to avoid PMI taxes.  Apple was the only stock I had ever bought and I think I had $80,000 saved up from it (another good success story). \n\nAnyways, the city kept growing and suddenly my house was now in the most desirable part of town in terms of restaurants and nightlife.  I could walk to the bars and the overall rent and property values boomed.  \n\n\nAgainst most logical advice, I wound up paying off the mortgage (I had a 3.3% rate) for peace of mind of owning my house.  However in 2020 during Covid I suspected interest rates would eventually jump up and inflation was occurring based on all the podcasts I was listening to.  So I refinanced, used this same Nvidia stock as collateral, and took out a home equity loan to renovate the back half of my house.  I have a $200k loan now at 3.5% but half of my property is now absolutely stunning with even more rental opportunity (I added a second meter and made it a multifamily).  The contractor wound up upside down on the framing part of the job because wood prices sky rocketed after our contract had been signed but he still made money on the project.  Renovating during COVID is another fun story though.  \n\nZillow shows the homes around mine are selling for $1.2-$1.5m, Zillow says my house is worth $1.8m but it doesn‚Äôt even know about the renovated 1,700 sqft addition and thinks the house is 2,600 sft.  It‚Äôs probably worth $2m now.  \n\nSo the short version is I bought a 4,600 sqft house at the bottom of the market after the Great Recession for $335k and after the COVID migration and some major renovation, the property jumped up to nearly $2m.  I‚Äôm $500k all in so that‚Äôs $1.5m profit if I ever sell.  \n\nThere is a homestead tax break for selling primary homes that you live in for 2 years but even if my wife and I move back into it at some point, that‚Äôs only a $500k deduction on $1.2m appreciation so we will still owe taxes on $700k which will suck.  Of course I can 1039 it into the next property and avoid the taxes altogether but it‚Äôs a really cool house in the middle of a really cool city.  \n\nSo there is one bad story and my best investment story.",

Said she \"trapped her son\" by getting pregnant at 16. Yet now they are 60 something and still together so that was quite the trap. Until the day that woman died she treated me differently than the other grandchildren.

Well, this was his dad. He should have gotten you out of this situation. Immediately. Full stop. \n\nInstead he told YOU not to cause a scene. Right after his dad screamed and threw a glass. So his dad did cause a scene yet your boyfriend tells you to act right? Honey, no. That is manipulation. He grew up in a home where this is ok behavior and it doesn't seem like he has learned it's not. That is a slippery slope for how he will treat you down the road. I would strongly recommend leaving. If not, bottom line, boyfriend needs therapy before you move forward in the relationship. And he needs to allow you to go no contact with his family.",

ICE is required to have a warrant to arrest citizens. they are allowed to detain and hand over to the proper authorities (usually local law enforcement in most of the recent situations) but that isn't always happening. legal citizens have been arrested and at least had the deportation process begin before realizing theyre citizens, but in some cases they have been completely removed from the country. ICE is also required to present proper identification before arresting someone or if requested by bystanders. it's not even just the masks (tho most states have laws against wearing masks and intimidating/assaulting others, which if they aren't properly identifying themselves would be a violation of those laws) but also just that there are a lot of times they won't even present a badge or anything. brandishing firearms on people exercising their first amendment rights (whether it's protest or recording interactions) is also illegal. so you're not only seeing people have their rights violated by ICE in an official capacity, but also because those agents are committing crimes themselves in the process which often nullifies the legality of the arrest. like if you have committed no crime and get arrested, that's already fucking up the first part of due process\n\n2.1 that's just ICE! the national guard and military were deployed in violation of the constitution so literally every. single. action. they. take. is in violation of due process. really nothing more to say there\n\n2.2 dont try to call out fallacies when you dont know what you're talking about\n\n3. idk man you just have a clear misunderstanding of due process then. due process is also not limited to the letter of the law, so there are often cases where violating just the \"spirit\" of due process is enough to be considered an actual violation. that's pretty much what occurs with a lot of protestor arrests, things like saying a bystander exercising their first amendment is interfering by yelling for identification or standing their ground and arresting them. the argument can be made there but most of the time its not considered valid\n\n4. I made no claim that military or national guard arrested anyone but I get why it can be taken like that. same stuff I talked about in 2.1, everything they do at that point is unconstitutional\n\nwelp, you tried. you also used the same exact argument that I called out, which relies on you not understanding due process to make (refer back to point 1). like its crazy how you understand the idea that due process is actually a broad term with many applications, but then you refuse to actually accept that its applicable in a wide variety of situations\n\nidk maybe reevaluate not only your view on due process and constitutional rights, and also your view on morality if you think that the situations I mentioned are okay regardless of legality",

      "text": "Well, this post managed to get a lurker to reveal himself!\nBeing cheated on myself after marriage for 7+ years and dated 3+ years prior, I know the support that you need right now.\n\nFirst, I would highly recommend seeking individual therapy if it is covered by your insurance or you can afford it.  I used to scoff at therapy, but the couples therapy and especially the individual therapy greatly helped.\n\nI also sought out as many stories from others who had been cheated on to try to understand what had happened.  So, here is my story for comparison...\n\n<history>\nMy ex had(has) some pretty severe confidence issues and a strange attraction to male dominance that stemmed from sexual abuse as a child and rape as a teen.  We had our ups and downs, but she was my first serious relationship and I loved her very much.  We had two beautiful children together and she helped me through some tough times including the death of my mother and grandmother due to cancer.\n\nI was out of work for several months and she started working at a local hardware store to help with the income.  She started to become more concerned about how she looked, her weight, etc. as she began to get attention from male customers and co-workers.  She started talking about one guy more often that she was going to lunch with.  This went on for a while and her behavior at home changed just enough I could tell something was wrong.\n\nThankfully, I was able to find out from one of her friends that they were meeting after work for some time.  I felt sick, numb and scared.  I had to confront her immediately.  At first, she dismissed me angrily for not trusting her, but she came around and wanted to talk.  I was finally able to get her to admit that she was cheating.  I had never felt such emotional pain.  I felt like I was punched so hard in the gut, that I would not be able to catch a breath again.  We cried together and shared the grief of that moment.  She said it happened only once and she was very sorry.  I believed her because I wanted to believe her.  We decided to stay together for the children and for us.\n\nShe still wanted to work in the same place, but she said she would tell him to leave her alone and he was going to talk to his wife (they also had 2 kids).  I again believed her because I wanted to and I was happy that she really did love me and wanted to work at the marriage.  Things went well for a month or so, but something wasn't right again.  This time I used my computer to get caller ID and record phone calls and found out they were still talking.  I collected enough evidence for myself and confronted her.  She denied until I played the phone conversation, but again her soothing words were what I wanted to hear.  This time I did require that we went to couples therapy.\n\nThis seemed to help a lot, but it would at times turn into an attack on me.  She brought up past wrongs that I had done (that I thought we had dealt with).  I later learned these were attempts at justification.  She did seem to improve quite a bit and I had to come to terms with the fact that she was in love with another man and me.  The therapist would then help her to understand that she needed to commit to the emotionally stable relationship (with me) and get away from the addictive excitment of a forbidden relationship (he was also dominating).\n\nWe continued with therapy off and on for 6 months and I caught her again.  I was getting so emotionally sick of this rollercoaster and the kids were suffering for it as well.  I then moved out with a friend (which is not a good legal decision when you have kids) and started individual therapy.  With the help of the therapist and the support of my friends, I finally moved back in and helped her to move out to an apartment.\n\nWe stayed separated for about 1 1/2 years.  During this time I continued individual therapy and we kept talking about keeping our marriage together.  The rollercoaster continued with me getting my hopes up and then dashed when I found out she was still seeing him.  Each time, I would grow a bit more numb towards her and tired of this limbo I was stuck in.  Finally, the therapist guided me to realize I needed to focus on myself to be a good father for my children and that they would be fine in a divorced situation.\n\nThis is where I also received two important pieces of advice from 2 friends:\n\n* The first was from a friend who had recently divorced.  He told that it will hurt like hell for a long time, but there is always a light at the end of the tunnel and you will feel so much better when you get there.\n* The second was from an older friend who had been married for 20+ years and had to deal with his wife cheating with 2 other men.  They spent several years in couples therapy to work things out.  He was the one who at first motivated me to try, but after seeing me struggle for over 2 years he finally gave me a bit more advice.  He said that he and his wife finally did get to a point in their relationship where they could say they were happy, but it was never even close to what he had before.  It was like the foundation was cracked and would never be the same as when it was first poured.\n\nI finally got the strength to tell her I wanted a divorce.  She didn't want to, but I told her that I needed to be completely separated from her to see if she could change on her own.  By convincing her that this was the only chance we could ever be together again, she agreed to joint custody and a fair divorce.\n\nI felt so good to have finally committed to a decision and went through with it with my eyes forward.  My friends were glad to see me finally out of that limbo and I finally started to recover.\n</history>\n\nI wish I could go back and tell myself to get out of the relationship when I found out so I could get back those 2+ years I had lost, but I know my past self would not have listened.  I know how hard it is for you to think about leaving and it is certainly not impossible for her to change.  You are very lucky that you don't have children right now, because that does complicate matters quite a bit.\n\nIf you do choose to leave, like everyone else has said, you will be fine eventually.  Also, there is a very good chance you will meet someone else or be very happy on your own.  This incident will become a painful memory that you will still grieve years later.  I will tell you that the 6+ months leading up to the divorce after I made the conscious decision to emotionally separate was, ironically, one of my best moments in life.  I felt empowered finally.  I was finally enjoying my hobbies again, reading more, exercising more, and growing more independent.  Keep in mind that this was after quite a bit of painful time trying to mend our relationship.\n\nIf you do choose to stay, I would recommend that you both get individual therapy.  Why not couples therapy?  In my experience, if you go to couples therapy they will try their best to get you to stay together.  This could be even if you aren't completely happy.  The therapist in that case can help you to adapt your view to become \"happy\" with some sort of compromise.  With individual therapy, the therapist is more focused on YOUR happiness.  You can still have sessions where you go to your wife's therapy or she goes to yours.  This way the therapist can see how you both communicate.\n\nIt obviously sounds like she has her own issues that may be rooted in some childhood trauma.  Her therapist could help her to work through that if she is willing.  Your therapist can help you to see if trying to stay together is really what is best for both of you.\n\nOne important thing to keep in mind if you do try.  This was a very important sign that my ex was not going to change easily.  The therapist tried to convince her that in order to regain my trust she had to give up her privacy for some time.  This would mean that I could call her anytime, have her check in with me, try to find another place to work away from this man, even allow the home phone to be recorded.  These would all be actions to show that she understood the hurt she had caused and she wanted to help rebuild our trust.  Of course this would not be forever.  I would gradually have to trust what she told me, then we would each have our privacy again.  She did agree to this in word only.  Her actions showed otherwise.  She wasn't willing to give up that much privacy.\n\nIf your wife is not willing to make those sacrifices to show that she is willing to regain your trust and that she truly wants to help herself, then definitely get out.  It really comes down to how much emotional energy you are willing to give.\n\nIf she isn't even willing to go to therapy with you (to make sure she goes for the first several sessions) and will not give up her privacy for some time (say 6 months), then you shouldn't spend your time just to keep getting hurt.  If she is willing and actually does continue, then you have to assess how deep are her issues?  Are you looking at 3+ years of therapy before she can reliably stop herself from doing this?  Could you be strong enough to stand by her through that time when she will most likely backslide?  Would you really want that?\n\nVery tough situation indeed and I really feel for your position.\n* MAN HUG! *\n\nI think you will be happier in the long run if you do get out now, but I also know that is not an easy thing to do.  It will most likely be a long hard road either way.  At least you know that you will eventually get better if you choose to leave, but if you try to work things out there is no guaranetee that she will get better.  Again, not impossible, but improbable and difficult for both of you.",

      "text": "[Tricks of the Trade by Matthew Baldwin](http://www.themorningnews.org/article/tricks-of-the-trade)\n\n\nActor\n Every actor eventually is called upon to act drunk. Most do this by slurring their speech, stumbling around, and perhaps drooling a bit. This is what a freshman drama teacher calls ‚Äúindicating.‚Äù A better way to appear drunk is to act very, very sober. Walk very carefully, and try not to let anyone see that you‚Äôre inebriated. This is much more subtle and will register on a level the audience won‚Äôt immediately recognize. \n\nAttorney\n Do whatever it takes to fit your contracts onto a single page: Format with single-spacing, use a 10- or 9-point font, and reduce the margins to less than an inch. Most people assume any contract that fits on one page will be simple and straightforward, and even sophisticated negotiators can be charmed by the lack of a staple. \n\nAuto Mechanic\n Always put copper grease on the battery terminals after servicing a car. The performance benefit is negligible, but when customers look under the hood they will immediately see that something‚Äôs changed and thus feel happy to pay you. \n\nBalloon-Twister\n When you‚Äôre twisting balloons for children, never tell them what you‚Äôre making. The majority of the finished products‚Äîdespite your best attempts‚Äîalmost always look like a dog, a blastula, or something vaguely phallic. If you identify what you‚Äôre actually attempting to make, the children will respond to your finished product with, ‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt look like a [insert animal name]‚Ä¶‚Äù But if you make the animals and then ask, ‚ÄúWhat does it look like to you?‚Äù the child‚Äôs imagination will take over, turning the blue, four-legged balloon into Blue from Blue‚Äôs Clues, the blastula into a Pokemon, and the phallic object into an elephant. You‚Äôll also get bonus points because you were so cool for making exactly what they wanted. \n\nBotanist\n When working in the field, stick a strip of duct tape to your pants. You can take it off while working to quickly remove large masses of ticks, biting ants, and thorns.\n\n If you know the length of each of your fingers as well as your handbreadth in centimeters, you can measure the leaves of most plants without having to pull the ruler out of your backpack.\n\n And when doing botanical work in South America, steer clear of the monkeys: They will throw sticks at you with surprising accuracy. \n\nButcher\n In Australia, the butchers have a secret language called ‚Äúrechtub klat‚Äù that they use to gossip about customers without getting caught. The code is formed by speaking words backward. Old-timers could have entire conversations in the language, but these days a core vocabulary of about 20 to 30 essential words are used. Sometimes, if a word can‚Äôt really be pronounced backwards, a couple of letters will be traded around (e.g., ‚Äútish‚Äù for ‚Äúshit‚Äù), or the first letter might be pronounced separately (e.g., ‚Äúbmal‚Äù is pronounced ‚Äúbeemal‚Äù). The most common words are: \nkool, toh lrig\ncuf ecaf\non erom feeb/gip/bmal\ntraf\ntoor\ndoog tsub\ntish\ndoog esra\ngaf\n Nothing is more enjoyable than shouting at the top of your lungs to the other butchers that the difficult customer right in front of you is a ‚Äúon doog cuf ecaf.‚Äù \n\nCardboard Box Flattener\n When hitting the sealed bottom of a cardboard box to flatten it, do not punch it with your knuckles like you‚Äôre boxing‚Äîthat will start to hurt real quick. Instead, strike it with the bottom of your fist, as if your hand were a gavel. \n\nCartographer\n Mapmakers will often use ‚Äúcopyright traps,‚Äù bits of information in their maps that are purposefully wrong. They might label a body of water ‚ÄúLake Strongbad,‚Äù for instance, and then examine the next editions of competitors‚Äô maps to see if the incorrect information makes an appearance. \n\nClarinetist\n Clarinetists in orchestras often need to swap between a clarinet in the key of B-flat and one in the key of A right in the middle of a piece‚Äîwith only about two seconds to spare. To do this they must yank the mouthpiece off the instrument they‚Äôre playing, grab the other clarinet from its stand, shove the mouthpiece onto the new clarinet, and drop the other one onto the stand. Worse, clarinets are black, clarinet stands are black, and this maneuver is usually done in the darkness of a concert hall. So what many clarinetists do to know which clarinet they‚Äôre holding is place a piece of blue painter‚Äôs tape on the back of one, or use thumb rests of different colors. And to help aim for the clarinet stand, some paint theirs with glow-in-the-dark paint. \n\nDesktop Support\n When desktop support technicians resolve a ticket, they are usually required to document the cause and solution to the problem. Supervisors see these records, so you have to be professional, but can usually get away with using the acronym ‚ÄúPEBKAC‚Äù in situations where the user caused the initial problem. PEBKAC stands for ‚ÄúProblem Exists Between Keyboard and Chair.‚Äù \n\nForester\n Never walk behind another person in the woods, because yellow jackets build their nests underground. The first person in line will disturb the nest when they walk over it, but it‚Äôs the poor suckers trailing behind who catch the wrath of the stirred-up bees. You can generally tell the more experienced forester in the group because he‚Äôll be the one in the lead.\n\n The senior forester also will be the one either driving the truck or sitting in the middle seat; it‚Äôs the guy who‚Äôs riding ‚Äúshotgun‚Äù who has to get out to open and close every gate they encounter. \n\nGraphic Designer\n If you have a client who is unable to approve a proposed design without putting her stamp on it, just put an obvious error in the proposal: a logo that‚Äôs too large, a font that‚Äôs too small, or a few judiciously seeded typos. The client requests the change and feels she‚Äôs done her part‚Äîand your design, which was perfect all along, sails through to approval. \n\nJeweler\n When setting a semiprecious gem, set a tiny piece of silver or gold foil behind it to make it sparkle.\n\n Also, because most stones are pretty irregular (being stones and all), fill the base of the setting with sawdust so the stone will set evenly. \n\nJuggler\n With any routine under seven minutes (which is almost all of them), you only really need one thing: a good closer. And there are only two things you really need to know about a great closer. First, it needs to be impressive. That sounds obvious, but most beginning jugglers think ‚Äúdifficult‚Äù and ‚Äúimpressive‚Äù are synonymous. Your closer must look hard, but there‚Äôs no real reason it has to be hard. Secondly, you should intentionally blow your closer on the first two tries. If you get it on the first try it looks too easy, but if you ‚Äúmiss‚Äù it a few times it looks harder and builds tension. \n\nLandscape Architect\n You will often have to create a large presentation for clients, and will spend hours coloring in landscape illustrations with markers. But if you say the drawings are ‚Äúrendered‚Äù rather than ‚Äúcolored,‚Äù you can charge four times as much. \n\nLounge Pianist\n Never agree to Christmas sing-alongs if there is alcohol involved. Your singer will only remember the first two lines of his favorite tunes, or you‚Äôll waste a half-hour on a drawn-out, stumbling, ‚Äú12 Days of Christmas.‚Äù The singer will be forgiven when he sobers up, but you‚Äôll look unprofessional. \n\nMassage Therapist\n In massage, properly orienting the top sheet over the client is referred to as ‚Äúdraping.‚Äù To keep female clients from having their breasts exposed while draping them for an abdominal massage, start with the client face up with the top sheet fully covering her from the neck down. Now, put a pillowcase over her neck, rumpled up. Pinching the pillowcase and sheet together, pull both down, with the pillowcase unraveling and trailing the sheet down the client‚Äôs body. Once the pillowcase has covered the breasts, leave it behind and continue with only the sheet until her abdomen is exposed. Tuck in pillowcase and sheet, and voila! \n\nMechanic\n If you have to change a light bulb where the glass is broken, you can press a potato into the metal base to unscrew the remains of the bulb from the fixture. \n\nNewspaper Headline Writer\n If you can‚Äôt think of a headline for a story, use one of these three magic verbs: ‚Äúweighs,‚Äù ‚Äúmulls,‚Äù or ‚Äúconsiders.‚Äù They‚Äôll work for pretty much anything from court stories (‚ÄúHamilton mulls plea deal‚Äù) to government stories (‚ÄúGovernor weighs Paseo extension‚Äù) to entertainment (‚ÄúColvin considers new album‚Äù) to features (‚ÄúBenson mulls those who consider weighing Kasey‚Äôs artwork‚Äù). \n\nNurse\n Patients will occasionally pretend to be unconscious. A surefire way to find them out is to pick up their hand, hold it above their face, and let go. If they smack themselves, they‚Äôre most likely unconscious; if not, they‚Äôre faking. \n\nParamedic\n When paramedics arrive at a car crash or similar accident, they very, very rarely announce any casualties at the scene‚Äîalmost all deceased will be pronounced ‚Äúdead on arrival‚Äù at the hospital. This is because it involves about 10 times more paperwork to announce someone dead right in situ than it does to say they expired in the ambulance on the way to the hospital. \n\nPhotographer\n When taking family portraits that include a dog, don‚Äôt use the dog‚Äôs name or say ‚Äúdoggie, doggie‚Äù to get its attention, because it might trot over to you. Instead, call out ‚Äúkitty, kitty, kitty.‚Äù The dog will perk up and look around for a cat, and you can get a great shot if you time it right. \n\nPiano Salesman\n If you see a potential customer eyeing a piano, estimate their age and calculate what year it was when they were 18 years old. Play a big hit from that year on the piano they‚Äôre looking at. With a lot of preparation and a little luck, you might play the exact song they were listening to when they lost their virginity, got married, or drove their first car. The emotional resonance will overcome sales resistance and even open their wallets to a more expensive piano. \n\nProofreader\n If you‚Äôre reading too fast, your brain can ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù typos, preventing you from catching them. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs sometimes a good idea to read a page upside-down. It forces you to pay closer attention to individual words out of context, and you can‚Äôt race through pages too fast. \n\nSoftware Tester\n Because developers don‚Äôt expect testers to read through their code, doing so is a quick and easy way to find possible bugs. Look for comments like ‚Äú// HACK‚Äù or ‚Äú// fix this crap later.‚Äù \n\nStreet Performer\n In street performance, it‚Äôs possible to make money without really knowing how to play your instrument. You can pick up a cheap accordion at a thrift store and simply make stuff up on the street corner. Most people usually won‚Äôt stick around and listen for long if you are on a sidewalk where there‚Äôs little room to stand, and you can play the same thing over and over and still make money. \n\nTechnical Support\n When helping someone fix their computer over the phone, and you want them to see if all the cables are plugged in correctly, don‚Äôt ask, ‚ÄúHave you checked to see if the cable is plugged in?‚Äù because the customer will always say, ‚ÄúOf course I did, do you think I‚Äôm a moron?‚Äù Instead say, ‚ÄúRemove the cable, blow the dust out of the connector, and plug it back in.‚Äù The customer will most likely reply, ‚ÄúHey, it‚Äôs working now‚ÄîI guess that dust really builds up in there!‚Äù \n\nWaitress\n When you realize you have forgotten to submit an order to the kitchen, go to the table and mournfully say, ‚ÄúDid you just hear that crash?‚Äù Nine times out of 10, the customers not only will say ‚Äúyes,‚Äù but actually will believe they just heard a noise of some sort. You can then sigh sadly, and say, ‚ÄúUnfortunately, that was the chef dropping your food,‚Äù and then scurry back to the kitchen to hand in the neglected order. \n\nWedding Coordinator\n People‚Äôs fingers swell when they get nervous. So, when exchanging rings, tell couples to only slide the ring up to the first knuckle and let the other person push it up the rest of the way. Otherwise you run the risk of the groom breaking his bride‚Äôs finger in the middle of the ceremony.",

      "text": "I'm a 28 yr old girl who's been married for the past four years. I was also diagnosed with vaginismus. Firstly, for everyone who is arguing that it's a physical or a mental problem, it can be both and often is. Yes, trauma, depression, and cultural and familial beliefs regarding sex,  can all play a role, as can physical problems such as hyper-toned muscles, injuries, etc. Oftentimes one can exacerbate the other.\n\nIn terms of treatment, I think the best approach is one that targets both the physical and emotional issues. Starting out with the kegal exercises and progressing to insertion of dilators is a good first step. I would recommend that she also try pleasuring herself- just clitoral stimulation to start out with. Also, it sounds to me like you and your wife have a narrow definition of what constitutes sex vs. 'fooling around'. If every time you attempt to have sex, it doesn't work out, this will lead to more feelings of failure, anxiety, frustration, depression, etc. Sex can also include any number of other intimate acts. I know you mentioned that she doesn't like to give blow jobs and she finds bodily fluids \"gross\". This is something that she is definitely going to need to work on. I would suggest that she goes to see a female therapist, preferably someone with experience in sex therapy. There is also some work that you need to do as well. While you say that you've been supportive, I've got to be honest and call bullshit on that. You mention that you've threatened divorce and using 'whores'. I get that you're frustrated and feeling desperate, but those threats only amplify the problem. I can only imagine that she feels resentment towards you for saying those hurtful things and a woman who resents you is never going to want to have sex with you. I think you've both got some issues to work on individually and as a couple.\n\nIn terms of other suggestions for her besides counselling, I've found a number of other treatments that worked for me. I started off with the kegels and the dilators as well, but I found the dilators to be excruciating to start with. Getting a numbing cream from my dr. really helped with this. She might want to try relaxation exercises, meditation, yoga, etc. to help relax her muscles and clear her mind. Once I was able to insert the largest of the dilators, my husband and I  moved on to inserting his penis. We used the numbing cream the first couple times, which really helped- the only problem was that he started to lose some sensation about part way through. Clitoral stimulation really helped as well because this kept my muscles relaxed and lubrication flowing. \n\nWhile my vaginismus is largely under control, it took a ton of work, on both my part and my husbands. We still have times every once in awhile when vaginal sex can be painful for me, but we try to be proactive about it by maintaining an active sex life and trying new things (e.g., using yoga positions together to get his penis in). The most important thing for me in terms of overcoming this was my husband's unwavering support. I cannot stress this enough. I know 10 months of struggling with this problem seems like a long time, but if you really love this girl and want to spend the rest of your life with her, give her some more time. Go to counselling together. Go to counselling individually. Do whatever you have to do to make sure that if you decide to end your marriage, at the very least you can look back and say \"I tried everything that I could dammit.\" I really hope that you're able to work through this together, best of luck.",

      "text": "I'm sure my advice will go unread since this thread has exploded in popularity, but FWIW:\n\nFrom what you've said, you like your overall job. You like problem solving and helping people. What's killing you is that you're being forced to be useless by lazy other departments and policy.\n\nSo, while you're looking for other jobs, why not see if you can make yours better? You don't have to quit to escape it - every company in the world is interested in becoming more effective. The problem for them is all the free advice everyone always gives them - they don't know how to filter out the chatter and have some impact.\n\nSo how about you? The way I see it, you're doing one thing very wrong: you're covering the other departments' backs when they are WRONG. Crickets? Then don't lie to customers. Say flat out that you don't have the ability to fix the problem they are reporting and you need to escalate it to development. Give them a ticket number and tell them you'll make development (or whoever) aware of it today. Record when they call back angry because nothing happened. Update the ticket. After a month, slap together a quick report in Excel and forward it to your manager and say, neutrally, \"these cases are still open and # customers are extremely frustrated about this. I'm not able to help them and [department] hasn't responded with a solution or estimate\".\n\nYou're not beating war drums and you're not creating conflict - you're just making decision makers aware of the problems. Don't forget your manager is more concerned with your department than the developers or the implementation team, because his performance depends on you.\n\nThe sweet part is, the day you get that new job and quit, you forward all those reports to upper management and say you're sorry to move on, but clearly _______ (name departments and names) weren't willing to improve service to customers, nor provide any indication of why they refused.\n\nDon't put up with shit from customers on the phone because you have to cover for someone. Tell the truth, and if the truth is something you shouldn't reveal, just say you're not allowed to disclose it.",

      "text": "A friend of mine was telling me just how bad the labor market is. So he's been without a job since the summer, he's a very poor college student on his last semester. \r\n\r\nThis past semester would have been his last but a lot of things went down last semester and he wasn't able to finish his final paper in time because he ended up being homeless and had to spend most of his time looking for odd jobs to feed himself and pay child support. That's right, he is trying very hard not to be a deadbeat Dad, to the point where he would rather find the money to put his responsibilities ahead of his future.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, he was in a car wreck last summer where some crackheads (not embelishing here) passed out in their car and swerved into his lane. He ended up T-Boning them and it killed one of the crackheads instantly and putting the other 2 in the hospital. He was lucky and only ended up shattering his clavicle (wearing his seatbelt) \r\n\r\nThe crackheads didnt have adequate insurance and his only paid a portion of his medical bills (we still don't know why and he's fighting it). He also ended up getting a crappier car out of the deal. The collision also messed up his back. Now this guy is a strong and tough guy, but even with the painkillers, the back pain limits his ability to do rigorous work for more than a few hours beofre the pain is intolerable.\r\n\r\nOn top of that, the poor sob got a felony on his record because of a bar fight where he ended up stabbing a frat guy cuz his \"bro's\" were harassing his friend, who's got a quirky sense of humor and pissed these guys off. Well quirky guy had just had surgery for testicular cancer and the fight would have put him back in the hospital. So \"B\" took a bit of drastic measures and stabbed the guy. Not his best decision, but I can't say anything because I've done the same thing, only avoided the felony because I have an upstanding job in the community and I know some people in the good ole boy network.\r\n\r\nAnyway, getting back to \"B\" The felony and the back issues have made it difficult to locate work in this community. So he sold his car, well low and behold, the one the insurance companies gave him had apparently been in a wreck once before and when he tried to sell it to a dealer they pointed out that the frame was bent and only gave him about $1500. He used this money to pay rent for a place to live (at about $100 a month) He also got back in school and gave some money to his baby's momma, who is very poor herself. They are trying to reconcile, but apparently this girl is bipolar and has some dependency issues, and \"B\" is more or less a loner. \r\n\r\n\"B\" also quit smoking, this is his second go at it, so that helps with the money issues, he also bought another car, for somewhere around $800, but now he's running out of money again and getting desperate. He said something to me today along the lines of \"When I was younger, I used to steal because it was fun, it was stupid, but we were just being stupid kids. Now, no one will hire me and I barely have enough to feed myself or my daughter, and I'm thinking about going back to stealing again, because now I need to.\"\r\n\r\nI've tried very hard to help him out, but he's very prideful; when it was bitterly cold here, he'd only stay with me on rare occassions, the to her time's he would stay in his car and sleep on the parkway, but then he sold his car, and felt that he had to pay rent for staying at a friend of ours' house. I leave food in their fridge, which inevitably gets eaten, but I know he's too prideful to take it if I directly offered it. All of this has him really depressed, and he's started to spend some of his money on Evan Williams and Glenlivet and I'm not sure what I can do to help him. So I'm actively looking for places for him to work as well, but it's hard because the job market is so bad here; that and the issues stated above. He's a smart guy for the most part, and he will have his Bachelor's in Anthropology if he just stays focused, but then who knows what he'll be able to do with it.\r\n\r\nI know some of you will think this is a troll post, and I know others that will say he did the crimes so now it's time for him to do the time, and I'd agree to an extent if there wasn't a kid involved. But I also know that if he could get a job, most of the problems that keep bringing him down would go away. I grew up dirt poor myself and I know how hard it is to pull yourself out of poverty, and I also know that I'd be in his situation if I hadn't had a helping hand to pull me out when I needed it most.",

      "text": "I really appreciate hearing thoughts from one of the people on the other side of the phone - I will remember this when I get frustrated with the growing lack of helpfulness I've experienced with \"technical support\" people in recent years. \n\nI've been unemployed for long stretches, and have been at my current job for about 4 1/3 years. The last time I was unemployed, it was kind of disastrous, although it ended up being one of the best things that happened to me in the long run - I moved to San Francisco, and although my financial situation isn't fully healthy, it's much better than it's been for a long time.\n\nI used to temp, and would use my unemployment benefits to fill in the gaps. There are definitely some benefits to this - I could work on my skills, set my own hours for doing things - lots of freedom. But I could never do anything or go anywhere, never buy new clothes (I remember not being able to buy new underwear for a looong time, and when I did it was from the drug store - I'm female so this is a big deal). I shopped at the 99 cents store for a long time at one point - I was simultaneously grateful and demoralized by this - you can find food there, really anything you need, but the quality is usually so poor. \n\nI never had money for emergencies. I couldn't fix my car. A number of times my utilities were shut off. My rent was always late (sometimes couldn't pay - my landlord was *very* understanding though). I couldn't take my cats to the vet, sometimes even when they really needed it. I couldn't buy birthday and Christmas presents. Most importantly for me, I couldn't travel to auditions or pay for lessons, coachings, whatever (I was trying to have an opera career, which was why I was temping in the first place - didn't want to get tied to a job). It got so bad I just stopped practicing, stopped caring.\n\nMy self esteem took a real smacking about, between the financial difficulties and the way people perceived me. I really never want to go through that again. I really am happy to have a job - although I do like it most of the time very much. I can imagine if I didn't I might be tempted to look elsewhere, but, given a choice, I wouldn't leave my job without having somewhere to go.",

At night, it was browse the internet until passing out.  My friends commented on how good I was looking, but I still hadn't found a job.\n\nI only made it about 8 weeks before I gave up.  It didn't help that one of my tires blew on the way to my first job interview.  I felt like such a failure.  I hated myself, stopped bothering to look for jobs, and started drinking dollar-a-gallon vodka to get to sleep.  Oddly enough, I kept up the exercise regimen... \n\nEventually, I sucked it up and called my family.  I expected to get berated for not having found work yet.  Instead, my dad drove 14 hours to come pick me and my shit up and move me back home.  I ended up spending most of a year unemployed, but I at least had family support.  I got my first job after that through a friend of a tuba-playing buddy of mine.\n\nUngrateful or not, stay in your job.  Either that or make sure you don't define your self-worth on your accomplishments.",

You have to do things, get your life in order. Start by collecting your trash and getting everything tidy. Then move on to your paperwork. Tomorrow, see about enrolling in a Dojo / Martial Arts class. This will give you discipline and self respect + confidence and you get to meet new people. Getting out of this depression is all about making you feel better about yourself. You wont feel better about yourself by sulking and indulging in video game escapism. You don't need medication as much as you need a baton jab to your backside. This is coming from experience. I had the exact same feelings and sometimes still do. You need to take a more active role in your life.",

I barely graduated from hs.  And yet i scored a 1270 on the SATs, and got honors on 2 golden state exams.  It's not that we're lazy, though it really appears that way, we're afraid of failure and realizing we're not as smart as thought.  \n\nI find it really interesting that you look down on everyone and feel they are inferior, because for the longest time - really felt this way too.  But i only alienated myself from others by thinking this way.  Because other people may not be as smart, but they still carry a lot of experience with them.  My turning point came when i joined the navy and was pretty much forced to study at my school, mandatory 30hrs a wk, at least 5 a day, this is in addition to the 7am-2pm classes i had.  This really forced me to study and not run away.  Now i am in college and sticking with it.  Theres plenty of times where i think im going to fail because i dont understand it, but i stick with it and end up doing quite well.  It may sound bad or condenscending, but when i doubt my ability to do well, i look at the people around me who are doing far worse but still have the guts to stick it through.

I can only say is write realisticc goals down on paper.  And look at it every day and ask youself that day how have you worked toward accomplishing them today.  This really requires a rewiring of your brain.  I still struggle with what you describe but am managing much better than in high school.

I feel like i accomplished something.  I am not in very good shape, but will run till i cra,p up and am tired as fuck.  And later pace myself better so i can make a routine.

      "text": "There's a lot of comments already and I don't know if you'll get the chance to read this, but...\n\nI, to some extend, share what you are feeling (when I was about your age)... My mom also groomed me to become great, constantly reminding me that I was better, smart, intelligent,... If mine and yours are alike, she is probably perfectionists. This trait will inadvertently rub off on children like ourselves. The side affect, however, is that we see the world in prefectionistic view - which to be honest, will be depressing. Moreover, failure, however little, will affect us greatly.\n\nFast forward to one random day, I was browsing the web when came across a story (a Chinese fable, i believe)...\n\"There was a man who grew up, determined to change the world. But the more he grew, the more he realized that the world would not sway. So he was set to change his nation. And as time pass, he see that his nation would not sway. Thus he set forth to change his city, but it would not change, it would not change. But it dawn on him that he has neglected his family, and he set out to change his family, but it was too late. And when time has finally caught up to him, he lay in his bed thinking to himself that if he has started out with changing himself, then perhaps, he could have changes his family, made a difference in  his city, moved his nation, and made the world a little better.\"\n\nThis story, to me, says that, \"change\" starts with us. It might sounds stupid and meaningless now, but as i look back, it changed my life.\n\nYou mention that you room is messy with trash all around and little incentive to make it better. You also mention that you want to be helped. If I can take that as \"I want to make myself better,\" then it is a perfect place to start. Use that perfectionist instinct to set your room up to your liking - make yourself proud. \nAlso, I don't know what you're listening to, but if it's kinda whiny, then may i suggest trying a different genre? something that can channel energy into you, something with fast beat. You know it once you've found it - it will compel you to move, your body will rock out instinctively. For me that genre was post-hardcore, My Chemical Romance to be specific. whatever it is for you, feel that energy, use that energy...\nMaybe pick up a sport too. I don't mean huffing and puffing at the gym or on the basketball court. Start out nice and easy, maybe taking a stroll, maybe just 10-15 minutes with your head phone blasting. then building it up over time. I was obese at your age, i had trouble walking up a flight of stair, but i can tell you that human are built hunters. You mentioned you feel more comfortable being in smaller group or by yourself. There are many sports that fit this description. Maybe after you have built up some energy with walking, you can pick up martial art...\n\nSorry, this is long, and i used a lot of \"i\", but i hope you can find something useful in this.\n\nBest wishes,\nCaptain, Oh Captain",

      "text": "-- Am I a case of I-need-to-get-the-fuck-over-myself-- YES.\n-- or have I been just dealt a fucked up hand and have more problems than people can count?-- WHAT problems? I don't see a problem. I, too, struggled with this \"is there something WRONG with me?\" phase from the time I was about 14 to just a couple years ago (i'm 25). I told my dad I thought something was wrong with me in my early teens, and should probably see a psychiatrist, which never happened because I was never willing to admit (100% to myself) that there was something wrong with me. I've come up with this self diagnosis: Spoiled White-kid Syndrome. It happens to too many people, and most of them never really grow out of it. Your life is kooshy, warm, loving, everything is made for you, everything bought for you, you don't have to lift much more than a finger, you go to school, see lots of other kids getting spoiled relatively the same way, but find every ounce of difference in other peoples' situations; the grass was always greener on the other side.\n\nmy mother died going on four years ago, and i was literally forced to grow up. she died when i was in my spring quarter of my third year of college, so it was up to me after that whether i needed to sulk the rest of my life about my dead mom or move on with my life as an adult, doing what she would have been proud to see me do all along.\n\nthough you didn't have this terrible thing happen to you, you are still in a great position to show your parents, friends and self that you are an adult now. you have been given the tools to survive thus far (all you NEED in life is food, shelter, and clothing), it's up to you to use those tools and do something you enjoy. by having only one ultimate goal, you are holding yourself back from the endless opportunities out there for you. what is \"normal\" anyway? what's normal for me is not normal for you, or my neighbor, dad, brothers, and best friends. do what YOU feel is right for YOU and don't let others tell you what's right for you, or what's \"normal.\" sure, it would be nice to have a family, stable job, 401k, blah blah blah. but for we 20-somethings, there is something else in store for our future. i think this 9-5 BS will become something of the past once \"we\" get in office.\n\nfirst things first, boost your self-esteem to get motivated for adulthood (sounds lame, i know). start exercising more, taking walks, jumping jacks when you're bored at home.. meditate. clear your mind of this mind jumble and get yourself focused on what's important NOW. eat healthy-- this is a must-- because food is power. if all you're eating is crap, you're going to feel like crap all the time. the fact that this is not common sense is beyond me. but feeling good about yourself begins with YOURSELF. do your body some good, and your mind will follow. get a job you wouldn't hate doing, and don't think about the \"what-ifs\" so much, they only make you fel depressed about your current situation. BE HAPPY. even if you're not feeling happy all the time, pretending to be happy makes you happy. smiling releases endorphins in your brain and makes you feel good, so don't forget to smile once in a while, even at yourself in the mirror.\n\nthis stuff sounds super silly, but i promise you... it works. what is NORMAL? there are no boundaries to your happiness if you believe that there aren't any.",

      "text": "Using a throwaway account for this.\n\nI'll be brief, but if you'd like me to elaborate just let me know.\n\nI can really relate to your situation. Growing-up, I was always one of the \"smartest\" kids in class. I never had to work to earn excellent grades in school. I was always really small for my age, but it wasn't an issue: I generally made friends easily and was happy. I was a good kid until I moved to a new town in 3rd grade, where I was suddenly a social outcast because of my intelligence and size.\n\nI started getting into a lot of fights to \"prove\" myself, and by the time I got to high school I'd pretty much checked out academically. I graduated with average grades, barely got into college with high SAT scores, and drank and smoked myself silly until I was kicked out.\n\nI went back and forth to various colleges, changed majors a bunch of times, and finally dropped-out because I couldn't stay motivated long enough to maintain my grades. If I applied myself, I got A's; the other 90% of the time, I got F's because I just didn't show up.\n\nRight around the time I left college the last time, I met the woman who became my wife and I slowly \"snapped out of it.\" Of course, by then I'd screwed myself out of a degree, and thus virtually out of a career. In the end, I had to get pretty creative and do a ton of work on my own time to finally work my way into a career to provide for my family.\n\nMy point is that it was ultimately my wife (and, subsequently my kids) who compelled me to shrug off my old skin and move on.",

      "text": "You need a social support structure of some kind. Start meeting people via meetup.com and okcupid.com. Second, you need to cut out the video games and computer. Third, you need to do your damndest to improve your \"sleep hygeine.\" Protip: playing the newest FPS will not help you sleep, and neither will surfing reddit at night. At all. Your escape is preventing you from hitting rock bottom, truly going insane, and finding salvation through boredom. But nobody hits rock-bottom unless they're brought kicking and screaming; personally, I just became numb to all forms of time-sinks. It wasn't something I did consciously, and I really don't like it, but it has changed my life for the better...sort of. If you really, really need just a little bit of internet, regiment yourself. For example, limit yourself to *only* the front page of reddit, the first page of /r/science, and 30 minutes on news.google.com.\r\n\r\n Start exercising, take walks to your local park. I do this almost every day. A lot of the time I go at 12 a.m., 3a.m., 4a.m., etc. because I have difficulty sleeping and huge amounts of stress and anxiety. Pull-ups on the monkey bars, some ab exercises, swinging on the swingset, you'll probably be exhausted in ten minutes. \r\n\r\nYou probably don't have enough music in your life. Video game music does not count. Pick up an instrument, download 100GBs of random music and play on shuffle on a radio in your house until you here something that plays at the chords of your very soul. A handful of good songs should maintain your sanity for a few hours, so you're constantly going to be scavenging.\r\n\r\n Sanitize your environment from distractions. If you will piddle time away in front of the TV, throw your fucking TV away (I'm serious. I did this.) Break your video games. Take a sledgehammer to your computer. Do not be a slave to your enviornment. Engineer your environment towards forced productivity. Hang out in the library more often, litter your room with books and textbooks. You may go so bored out of your mind that you'll just start doing laps around the kitchen table just to not go completely insane; that's fine, it's all part of the boredom process. Boredom is purifying.\r\n\r\n Another thing that's purfifying? Meditation. Devote ten minutes a day to meditation, but add one minute each day until you get to thirty. I recommend this website, it will probably \"understand\" you: http://www.vipassana.com/meditation/mindfulness_in_plain_english_3.php \r\n\r\nPersonally, even after all that stuff, I'm pretty nonfunctional. Actually, kind of in the same boat as you. Although I get my dick wet, have friends, and regularly accumulate structured knowledge towards a goal, I still don't do well in school. There's a lot of times when it's hard to feed myself or even get out of bed. Sometimes I cry from the smallest things. Por Ejemplo, at Blockbuster I saw the title of the movie \"The Cove\" and started shedding tears. Do I give a fuck about Dolphins? No. Am I an animal rights fag? No. It was embarassing, frankly. I must have cried twenty times during Avatar. I got put on a mood stabilizer called Seroquel, but I've only been on it a short time though it seems to be effective so far. \r\n\r\nGet into the Big Brother program. Helping other people makes you slightly happier. Besides, all you have to do is play video games and go to the park with some kid once a week. This works wonders with the girls and makes everyone think of you as \"not a worthless piece of shit\".  \r\n\r\nStop buying junkfood. Junkfood is clearly a choice and definitely a case of \"get-the-fuck-over-yourself\". Here's an idea: if you've regressed to not being able to do anything for yourself, start drinking milk instead of eating crap. It's a perfect protein with an optiumum macronutrient ratio. That's what I do. Yay for my milk, orange juice, and protein powder diet! Only buy healthy things from the store, even if it's lazy healthy things. I like buying orange juice and a \"complex gainer\" I get from bb.com. It's a cheap, easy source of sustenance that requires almost no work if you've got a blender. \r\n\r\nStart making a habit of doing pushups randomly, doing situps randomly. Even if you don't do a lot and half-ass it, still do it. You want to wear yourself out a bit. Believe me, when you're bored to death, even when you're depressed you'll grunt out ten pushups in a day. It's not about getting \"buff\", but it makes a small dent in your mental state: TRUST.\r\n\r\nOkay, so let's review:\r\nSocial Support via internet (this is a numbers game, don't give up)\r\n\r\nSanitize your environment from distractions and time-sinks and junkfood. You want your 'most effective' time-sink to be something lame along the lines of catching flies or running around your table or reading a book. Don't be spoiled. I find taking a lot of showers helps relieve boredom and stress, but it makes my skin dry out because I tend to work out a lot to relieve this fucking tension. \r\n\r\nFind music that plays upon your heart-strings by brute force of interwebz. Don't sit there actively listening to each song. Your attention will be extremely forcefully grabbed when the song that is \"just right\" comes on. Don't expect to find the rights songs even after 50GB of listening. \r\n\r\nMeditation/Mindfulness: This is more like putting money in the bank. Don't expect to see any results for at least a few months or a year. One of the most important thing mindfulness teaches you is the value of 'feeling' rather than discursive/analytical thought. It's a matter of manipulating qualia. What kind of discursion arises when you ponder the Zen Koan of Joshu and his reply to whether a dog has buddah-nature? None, really, it all gets tangled up by the inherent nonsensicalness. You want to zero in on this qualia of thoughtlessness and serenity. It's something you have to practice, a lot, but it's definitely legit once you get the hang of it a bit. \r\n\r\nEven after all of this, you might still need medication. But only seek medication after you've completed all these steps and waited 3 months.",

Getting off of the internet and doing something about your life is...well, you probably don't like to admit it, but this post belies the fact that despite how intelligent you believe yourself to be, you have *no idea where to start.* \n\nAnyways there's no point in repeating things you can conclude on your own after reading that article. Please consider professional help. Redditors aren't going to tell you anything beyond *LOL PULL YOURSELF UP BY YOUR OWN BOOTSTRAPS!!* I'm not trying to be facetious here, just stating the facts: it's pointless to tell someone who thinks they're more intelligent than the rest of society yet still has problems taking the garbage out consistently to pull themselves out of a rut they themselves have trouble identifying. This is why professionals exist. They are smarter than you, and most importantly, they are *not you* -- they can see your issues objectively and with a great deal of expertise in dealing with them.",

From what i've read so far is that it all comes down to a lack of ambition. Ever wonder why the idiots of the world make it to the top? They may be dumb as a door nails but they have the ambition of champions. You define your own reality. If you tell yourself you are going to do somthing it's possible. The human mind can manifest anything it wishes with enough ambition. Want to design cars? Learn Auto-cad and spend all your free time on it. Want to design great game graphics? Spend all your free time doing nothing but 3d software and photoshop. Apply for internships at graphic design houses. You are only 22 years old and by no means is anything slipping away. You still have plenty of time to do whatever you wish as a career. \r\n\r\nThe best advice I can give is set yourself rules. Tell yourself that you are going to game 1 hour a day and that is it. You are going to study your trade X amount of hours a day. Make a schedule and follow it, no more of this freestyle as you go living. Once you make things like this a habit they will become second nature to you. Cheers and good luck.",

      "text": "Doctor evil here... here's a short story for you, hope it cheers you up, don't take it too seriously though.\n\nRegular people are shit, 9 to 5 is for drones. If you feel like it, accept it. You are not regular. Who cares if you sleep all day and stay up all night. If you are not classically educated and don't care about it, fuck it. You can improvise, you can learn. Read wikipedia, google, learn the basics of scientific method, that can already get you far. Just try to get a verifiable realistic vision about your abilities. If they are nonexistent, it's ok. At least you know what you have to work with. What is it that you really want to do and what's stopping you? You don't really need any skills to accomplish anything. You just need time to plan, test and execute a realistic plan. Are people your problem? If it's just money you need? Then you have few options. \n\n1) Get a job, but since you hate these drones and their society just get a trivial (night) job or something that doesn't tax your low IQ of 154 too much, try to minimize your contact to these 9 to 5 people who want something from you, you don't really need them. Get a small buffer money before spending any, just in case. Enough to buy time for few months of planning. Use the money you get from your mandatory weekly torture (work) to live a simple life and have your own hobbies which nobody cares about and have no real business potential in this world, but still make you happy. If you learn to accept what you are you will be happy even if you are alone. If someone comes along, great. If not, no biggie. Just try to exercise enough self disipline to take care of your body, othervice life will become tough.\n\n2) You gamble, that is to say you plan and execute a crime of some sort, a singular crime which will set you up for life. Not a fancy life, but a life worth living for. You plan everything. Circumstances when and if you are willing to kill and how many. Estimate and accept a realistic likelyhood for your capture or death. Stay calm and execute your preplanned rules to the letter. Expect the unexpected. Schedules fail, machines break. You estimate the probabilities and choose failure scenarios. You set the amount of gain you require, but be realistic. No more, no less. Run the simulations, choose your irrelevant parameters by random, diversify, be unpredictable when possible. You need to be willing to accept a failure and still feel good about yourself. Don't take anyone with you, don't tell anyone what you are about to do, they'll only be trouble and in the process you might ruin someones life you really didn't need to or want to. If you need to deal with people, make everything you want crystal clear as well as the consequences and stick calmly with them to the letter. Try to avoid people though, they are wildcards. If you run into trouble make sure you eliminate problems ones and for all. You do this only once, if it backfires you retreat to plan 1 and never look back, possibly after prison if it comes down to that. Expect only moderate gain, be ready to invest and diversify all that you get. Live a moderate regular life. You still have more than 50 years left, corrected by inflation thats a lot of capital you need.\n\nIf your pleasure is not only money, but you also wish for more personal contact with people you could maybe play the chameleon card even if you are not willing to conform to the social constructs and rules of academy etc.\n\n3) Some intelligent people can socially engineer their way with only a little bit of lying not really legally dangerous to some pretty interesting jobs and even do relatively well in them. As long as you don't constantly need hard bookshelf rules you can do quite ok without any formal education or training in several jobs just by improvising and learning as you go, even some highly respected jobs may be accessible if you only start asking. You might notice that in fact you'll become in few months much more proficient in some tasks than your coworkers who've worked there for years. If you manage to do this learning alone you'll appear even more impressive. You can lie to an extent to avoid some initial logistical blockages, but try to avoid that. Instead be political, never promise anything, say maybe, overestimate or underestime, whatever serves your purpose. Just make it sound good. Plan your processes so that if a failure occurs the fault was someone elses or in the general circumstances out of your control. Learn to recognize when a social path becomes too dirty to proceed. When the whole environment becomes a minefield it's time to bale out. If the environment is initially hostile try to collect as much dirt on other people as possible. Most people make stupid mistakes even if they really are professionals, you don't necessary do these kinds of mistakes yourself. However don't use this dirt for anything unless absolutely necessary and even then minimize the punishment, just make sure people understand that you are not to be fucked with. If it becomes obvious people have some serious dirt on you it's time to bale out before they have a chance to use it. Most people are more afraid of their own mistakes and being blamed for them than mistakes of others. Remember the mistake of an employee is a mistake of the employers. People will forgive you to an extent, especially if it makes them feel \nbetter of themselves. You can sometimes use this to your advantage. Just learn to recognize what is a serious mistake or a cituation and what is not. In general it is often a good idea to stay silent. Sometimes it's also a good idea to openly play dumb. Hide your strengths until you need them.\n\nOK, so obviously most people are not psychopaths, but sometimes if the alternative is a suicide it could be worth trying. It could even be fun. The simplest advice I can give is that if you are unable to just \"suck it up\" then at least just go out, ask around, try things and don't be afraid to make mistakes. If you have nothing, there is nothing really to lose. If you get fired or something, who gives a shit. At least you've lived, it can be exhilarating experience to fail or to get fired. Throw out your ego, everyone is a loser, including the CEOs. Remember, most professionals aren't really *that* good at what they do anyway, they are just experienced and know jargon and protocol which at first makes them seem as if they know what they are doing. Observing them for a while makes it obvious they are just as fallible as you, sometimes even more so. If all else fails, move somewhere far away, somewhere quiet, somewhere where nobody knows you, and live a simple life, a happy life. You parents really just want you to be happy, whatever makes you happy makes them happy.",

      "text": "Cool story bro.\n\nActually i really feel like a lot of what you wrote reflects my personality in high school.  I really think, as you said, that a lot of it is because we grow up with everyone telling us how smart we are and because of that we expect everything to be easy to learn, and when it isn't we flake out.  I barely graduated from hs.  And yet i scored a 1270 on the SATs, and got honors on 2 golden state exams.  It's not that we're lazy, though it really appears that way, we're afraid of failure and realizing we're not as smart as thought.  \n\nI find it really interesting that you look down on everyone and feel they are inferior, because for the longest time - really felt this way too.  But i only alienated myself from others by thinking this way.  Because other people may not be as smart, but they still carry a lot of experience with them.  My turning point came when i joined the navy and was pretty much forced to study at my school, mandatory 30hrs a wk, at least 5 a day, this is in addition to the 7am-2pm classes i had.  This really forced me to study and not run away.  Now i am in college and sticking with it.  Theres plenty of times where i think im going to fail because i dont understand it, but i stick with it and end up doing quite well.  It may sound bad or condenscending, but when i doubt my ability to do well, i look at the people around me who are doing far worse but still have the guts to stick it through.  The 'not so smart' people really inspire me to work harder.\n\nI am not saying im a genius, a 1270 on the sat ior a 29on the act, s no where near that, but still very competitive scores.  I can only say is write realisticc goals down on paper.  And look at it every day and ask youself that day how have you worked toward accomplishing them today.  This really requires a rewiring of your brain.  I still struggle with what you describe but am managing much better than in high school.  But once i get my life together everything becomes super focused and i cannot stop being awesome.  This is good and bad..  what i have found to help get out of a slump is when the first moment occurs to me that something needs to change, i do it instantly regardless of time.  Its a bit harder with studying as not many places are open to study late.  Studying at home is super difficult for me, so many distractions.  I usually stay at the library and work there.  But usually my recovery begins with exercise.  The first thing i do when i decide to get better is run.  Whatever time it might be, in the hotass sun or in the middle of the night.  I feel like i accomplished something.  I am not in very good shape, but will run till i cramp up and am tired as fuck.  And later pace myself better so i can make a routine.  And this kinda gets everything into place.  The key part is just not hesitating when you know something needs to be done.\n\nEdit. Sorry for any typos.  I type this all on my phone because i really wanted to reply.",

      "text": "I dropped out of high school on numerous occasions (dropped out, went back, dropped out, went back) but finally stopped altogether at 16. Just like the OP, all of my life all I ever heard was how smart I am, how gifted I am, and once I actually had to try - I quit. I was very good at laying blame on others, especially my parents, and in general very lazy.\n\nAt 18 I was doing nothing but smoking copious amounts of weed and partying in general - as had been the case for several years prior. I had no goals other than wake up, get stoned, find others to enable the lifestyle. \n\nAbout 6 months after turning 18 I joined the army (there's more to it than that, really I followed a guy I was enamored by, but that's another story.) Bear in mind that this was 1999, Clinton was President, the \"times\" were a bit different. \n\nSuddenly I had goals. They were small, but cumulative. My first goal was to pass the urine test, and physical, at MEPS. I was in generally good health, if a little overweight. The next goal was to work on learning to do the pushups/situps/running required to complete basic training - this was before I even \"shipped off.\"\n\nThe first huge mistake was joining to follow love. It may sound romantic but it was, clearly, completely stupid. I signed up for 6 years doing a job I had no interest in - also both gigantic mistakes. But, I had to live with them. The lover and I were \"together\" all through basic and AIT, and it worked out fine, but it didn't last long after that. I ended up the better person for it all in the end though - in general.\n\nI loved basic training. I learned to love learning again. I had to put forth effort in every direction I never had to before. Physically, mentally, etc.\n\nI finished my 6 years and narrowly escaped stop loss. Now I'm a full time student (hopefully in nursing soon) and I don't have to pay a dime for school (thanks to the post 9/11 gi bill.) This is an opportunity I would not have otherwise. In all likelihood I would have ended up pushing out babies before 20 chasing baby daddies around for child support and either never obtaining a career or struggling to do so. Instead I gained a distinct sense of independence and a real chance to do what I want with life.\n\nIt was the worst decision because you're helpless. As I said, I joined in 1999. I never imagined in 2003 I would be sent to invade a sovereign nation based on lies. I always imagined if I went to war during my enlistment it would be for something good and just - but at 18 I really didn't know any better, I had no sense of politics, I was completely apathetic. I also hated my job. I joined as an avionics and armament repairer on scout helicopters. If I had it to do over - I certainly would do it over - but I would have been better suited as a linguist or medic or something. \n\nNow I know exactly what I want to do in life, I have my goals and I'm working toward them. Sure, it's possible to do that without military intervention, but sometimes a dire situation calls for drastic measures. The OP sounds *so much* like me, it's the kind of lifestyle change that can't help but snap him out of it.\n\n* Never sign up for more years than you have to.\n\n* Completely research jobs and find the one that's right for you.\n\n* Never let the MEPS officer tell you the job is full. Do not enlist unless you get the job you want. Leave the office - they *will* call you back.\n\n* Never let them tell you you cannot get a bonus - once again, leave the office and do not enlist - they *will* find one.\n\n* Never assume you won't get called on to do something heinous that you morally disagree with - you most certainly will.",

      "text": "Get her off coke and make sure to provide a very strong social support for her. Set rules, but make sure you can support her into doing something usefull with her life. If there is a community college nearby may be she should start attending, but do not let her move out. Sit down and explain that she is loved, but she is ruining not only her life, those of her family too. You as the big bro if you know cool fun people should take her out with you. Introduce her to some of your friends if you haven't done already. Nice kind of people she might like. Make sure if she passes time with you it's not a crazy party, but more of a chill evening with friends. It sounds to me like she is unsatisfied with the family affection and in college she found that some other people appreciate her too (wrong kind of people apparently), so she is going all out to get their attention and approval. In a way, sounds like a good girl, going through teenage bull at a later stage and more extreme. You have to be there for her. No matter what bullshit she might throw your way, she has to know that you and you parents love her. Talk to her explain how things are, but keep your cool and don't get pissed off, and make sure your parents don't get pissed off too. She has to know that you love her, but on the other hand do not indulge her. Explain to her that despite all the love, she has lost your and your parents trust and thus will need to win it back, by her actions. But really you and your parents need to either open up a new circle of friends for her or put her in a place, where she is likely to find nice people that are going places, to motivate her to lift herself out of that shithole. Because once you fall down into this kind of hole, especially if you grew up in a nice well to do family than your become embarrased that you are in this hole and you don't want family and other friends to see you like this.\n\nOn the abortion, I personally am anti-abortion, but I don't know how it works in your family. Personally I would expect support from my parents if I was in this situation (I mean say I was with a kid, not pregnant, I am a guy), but it's a free coutry, and abortion is still legal (get it while it lasts!).\n\nIndependant of abortion, its really a fine-act of setting some rules and showing your love for her. As you are preatty close to her age, you really have to put in the effort to spent time with her, if your parents plan on going on holidays, you should definatly do this as a family. It sounds like you can afford it. Rent a cottage, and spend a week there. You've got to really bring her back into the family, so she can rebuild her foundations and then start going forward. And do not I repeat DO NOT, keep her telling about opportunities wasted etc. The message should be that God still loves... sorry so I was saying that you and your parents still love her. \n\nSorry for the long post, and one last thing. It's not going to be fast, nor easy, but if both you and your family are dedicated you should pull her out.\n\nI typed preatty fast and didn't spell-check sorry for the errors.",

      "text": "As bad as this sounds, it sounds like she's \"finding herself\" the hard way.  Sometimes those early 20's are tough.  She'll come out of it (I hope, for everyone's sake) and one day she'll be better for it.  I really feel all you can personally do is get her off the coke, introduce her to some of your friends, female ones you trust preferably (provided that you think their personalities will gel).  Possibly invite her to social gatherings where you can watch her and she can be around people that will treat her nicely.  Try to restructure a relationship with her.  Make her feel loved.  It sounds like she feels like the most unloved creature in the world and so she is purposely degrading herself, her body, and her emotions in hope of feeling validated.  Watch who she dates.  She sounds pretty impressionable and vulnerable to me.  If you surround her with loving, genuine people, you can only hope from there.  All of this advice is completely dependent on how far she will let you in also.  Try to seem disarming and not meddlesome.  If she goes off the deep end and you are afraid for her life, there's always rehab.  She might not thank you for it at the time but hopefully after a while, she'll come to appreciate it.\n\nWhile I've never personally been full on addicted to coke, I've dabbled.  I have a lot of friends who were heavily addicted.  I was once heavily addicted to any amphetamine that I could get my hands on.  I would snort or take up to 16 Ritalin, Adderal, or any other pill a day for 2 years.  Keep in mind, I weighed 105-110 pounds.  Thank god Meth wasn't around me back then, who knows where I'd be now.  All of that shit tends to blow your emotions out of proportion and eradicates all semblance of logical thought.  I burned a whole hell of a lot bridges back then and ended up homeless for a while.  I was younger than her though.  I was stubborn and proud like her.  I thought I was a real hardass but really I was a balloon full of emotion just waiting to pop, either collapse in on myself or collapse on someone's doorstep.  My parents sent me to Psychologists who piss tested me (I guess they didn't realize that and pill I snorted or took was out of my system in a couple days especially since I was drinking so much water to pass the tests), they kicked me out, etc...  I eventually quit myself and buried myself in books instead of speed.  I know of a lot of old Elementary and High School buddies that OD-ed.  I was on a singular path of destruction and made up my mind that was basically my fate.  I kept trying girls (very sweet, innocent ones who lived normal lives and couldn't understand me) who all dumped me because I was \"emotionally needy\".  Very dark times.  I tell you all these things so you can maybe understand what someone feels like on this path.  She sounds a lot like me back then only I am a guy and didn't have women around enabling me.  Vulnerable, terrified, determined to kill myself if not immediately then eventually.  Desperately in need of a friend, a lover, companionship of some form or other; cocaine is her substitution for that.\n\nA lot of people seem to be saying that her parents need to cut her off, that you and everyone needs to come down with the hammer of Thor and make her really sorry about what she's done.  I'm not altogether sure this is a good idea.  It could have a great outcome or it could have a really really terrible one.  When they cut her off, she could just fade into obscurity, enable herself, hit rock bottom.  What happens after hitting rock bottom?  Rock bottom is really far down.  There's always Meth or mixing any and every drug she comes in contact with (which will lead to an OD, not if but when).  Hopefully she would snap out of it and wake up from her nightmare.  That is the risk you take and you have to prepare yourself for the outcome, which you know, could be death.  No one wants that, not even her though she might disagree with that.\n\nGetting her off of the coke is going to take tact, that is if you don't want to teach her the hard way and suggest to your parents that she go to rehab.  Just think about what is within your means.  You know better than anyone.  Advice on what needs to be done is only that, how you apply it is the important part it can only be up to you.\n\nYou said yourself that \"you don't even know who she is anymore.\"  My friend, there is only one way to figure out: be around her as a benevolent part of her life.  Don't expect that storming on the scene, picking up all her shit, and moving her will change everything.  She will probably just resent you and all the pathos that led to this behavior will still be present.  Take a week and hang out with her.  Talk about the people she knows, the guys in particular, learn about her habit as hard as it is to listen to probably.  Hell, snoop around if you feel comfortable.  You want to know if she's still using?  Find her stash.  Try to get as much information as possible in as little time as possible and when you understand the situation.  Systematically cut those magnanimous things in her life.  More importantly, ask her, \"What has this gotten you so far besides heartache and the possibility of a very harrowing, dismal, and even possibly short future?\"  There is only one answer to that: Nothing.  When she can say that and believe herself, she'll hopefully want to move onto something else.\n\nEdit: Now that I am feeling way sentimental, I'm going to go to bed listening to We Shall All Be Healed.  I hope that my advice as well as everyone else's helps.  Also, I support the abortion decision if that is what it comes to.  She needs to get her shit together before she brings a child into the world.  I think her excitement about the child was put into motion by her desire to love something and something love her back...loneliness.  If she has a child and continues like this, the child will end up hating her most likely and she will be back to square one.",

The situations everyone on here share may be similar but don't forget you are dealing with different people with different minds!\n\nWhat I would suggest you do is be straight forward. Tell your sister everything you posted here... hell I would even show her this post along with all the comments people posted. MAYBE that would get through to her. Most importantly let her know she is lucky she has a family she can go to when in need but she shouldn't take advantage of that every time she screws up. The best advice I can give you, as a person who has seen this a lot, is to just be honest. In most cases these situations honestly do not end well but you have time to change it still.\n\nInvite her over and sit her down with your whole family. Let her know her life is just as important to you and your family as it is to her. Let he know you want to help her get back on track but she is going to need to cooperate with you and by doing so she is going to have to live home again. I would also remind her that it is never too late to make a change. She is still young and she can overcome this. She is your sister, do not cast her away. Don't chase her and give her everything she wants either. There has to be a clear understanding between her family and self.\n\nIt is very courageous to write everything in detail, as you have. You obviously feel strongly about this. Rehab centers and psychologists will not work as well as family. This may be a lame high school technique but why not show her some real life stories to maybe inspire her to move forward? It can help!",

She still relies on them, so they should be able to use their influence over her.  I'm sure that they won't be able to send her to her room or ground her, but they should make 'suggestions' in the form of \"We don't think you should go to that party.\"  I think it goes without saying, but all of her finances should be controlled by you parents.  This is the main place that rule setting should come in.  Try to get her to do it voluntarily, but never leave her with enough money to go buy cocaine.",

      "text": "I was homeschooled from kindergarten up to junior year of high school.  Most of high school I went to small classes held for homeschoolers and then junior year I took classes at a local college in my town.  I was also heavily involved in speech and debate in high school. I wanted to go to a private school for senior year because there was a girl that I liked.  I had no trouble fitting in, played sports and eventually started dating the girl.  In college I studied a hard science and graduated at the top of my class.  \n\nNow I'm married to the girl and am working at a job considered by many to be one of the most difficult and prestigious jobs one can get out of college.  \n\nI owe it all to homeschooling, my mom spent innumerable hours poring over my work and helping me understand what I needed to do.  She spent so much time researching the best classes for me to take that would supplement her expertise, and then driving me all over to these classes.  She forced me to do speech and debate until I liked it which ended up being my favorite part of high school, and has helped me achieve what I've wanted.  I have a great group of friends who have similar backgrounds as well.\n\nTL;DR: homeschooling was the best thing that ever happened to me.\n\nEDIT: Something that I feel is sometimes left out of the discussion is the role of the parents in the success or failure of homeschooling.  There are two critical questions that must be answered before you can talk about the success or failure of homeschooling.\n\n1. Why are the kids being homeschooled?\n2. How involved will the parents be?\n\nMy parent's reason for 1. is that they felt I was not getting the education that I needed in the public school system, and thought that through a combination of their own expertise and hiring outside teachers for material they didn't know I would learn much more at a much greater depth.  As for 2, My dad wasn't super involved in my education because of his career but my mom treated my education as a full-time job.  She would spend roughly 45-50 hours a week working with me, grading papers, going over materials, taking me to exhibits and museums to enhance what I was being taught.  This was a massive commitment by my mom, and the endurance she had to put up with my typical teenage bullshit day in and day out while still trying to teach me amazes me.  \n\nI really think that the parents need to desire the best education possible for their kids and treat that education as a full-time commitment to make it work.",

          "text": "I think my homeschool experience was pretty different from yours, but I agree with your TL;DR. It was about the best experience I could have hoped for. \n\nI was in public school from kindergarten through 5th grade, homeschooled for 4 years, and reintegrated into a traditional schooling environment in 10th grade. I've suffered from social anxiety for most of my life, and by the end of 5th grade, the thought of going to middle school terrified the shit out of me, so I begged my mom to let me homeschool. She did some research and finally decided to pull me out of public school and give homeschooling a try. \n\nMy schooling during that period was nearly 100% self-directed, as my (single) mother worked full time. She did, however, put together a rock solid curriculum for me to follow, and she tested me in each subject regularly. \n\nI loved every minute of it. I was usually able to get my daily work done in less than 3 hours, and I spent the rest of the time playing video games and surfing the internet. I essentially taught myself math (through algebra II) by just reading the text books and doing the problem sets, and we had a mix of text books and computer programs to fill in the rest of the subjects (biology, general science, music, etc.). We even got dissection kits for biology (I never ended up using them, though, lol). For English, I was enrolled in a correspondence composition I course from a local university.\n\nCompared to public school, I felt completely free. I could study what I wanted, when I wanted, and as long as I passed my tests, I was free to spend my time however I liked.\n\nI eventually decided that I wanted to go back to a traditional school environment, as, obviously, my social interaction was pretty limited. We occasionally went to homeschool meet-ups where I could interact with other homeschooled kids, and that was okay, but I was still struggling with social anxiety issues, and I wanted to face them head on.\n\nWhen I got back in to traditional school, I had zero problems keeping up with the material (I had already done most of it). The social aspect, on the other hand, was a little more difficult. I still struggled with social anxiety and depression, but by the end of my senior year I was doing okay. I went into college feeling fully prepared both academically and socially.\n\nIn short, I don't think homeschooling held me back at all. From an academic standpoint, I achieved more while homeschooling than I think I would have in public school. From a social standpoint, I can't really say. My social anxiety was already holding me back in that regard, and I'm not sure middle school would have helped things. OTOH, I was only homeschooled for 4 years, and some of the kids I met through homeschool programs who had been homeschooled their entire lives did seem to be quite a bit behind in their social development.\n\nAs with anything, everyone has a different experience. I've seen homeschooled kids who come out just fine, and I've seen public-schooled kids who are completely fucked up. Everyone is different, and what works for one kid doesn't always work for everybody. That, I think, is the best aspect of homeschool, and I think it worked pretty well for me.",

This teacher was always yelling at students about how stupid they were and that they were never going to be smart enough to move on to the 3rd grade - this was before \"No Child Left Behind.\"  So she goes to the principal's office and voices her concerns about the learning environment in which the children are being forced into and the principal replies that it's none on my mom's business.\n\nWe were pulled out at the end of that school year.\n\nI was homeschooled from 5th-11th grade and went back for my senior year so I could take a bunch of computer networking classes that I was interested in and I feel like it gave me a leg up.  I knew how to study on my own, what to do to get things done and I integrated easily with the other students, many of whom I remembered from my days of elementary school.\n\nThe kids that are FUCKING WEIRD are those that sheltered from society because their parents want to force-feed them bullshit political/religious beliefs that totally screw these kids over for years to come.  These are the same kids that get married at 18-19 years old because they want to have sex without it \"condemning them to Hell\" so by the time their 21 or 22 they already have a couple of kids and are screwed because they never went to college - their job is to have babies and raise a family as taught by their parents!  It's completely messed up.\n\nI always felt it was an advantage for me, however, I know that it's not something I'm going to do for my kids.  If I have to I'll just send them off to private school if I don't feel that their needs are being met by the educational system.\n\n**TL;DR** - It depends, if it's for religious reasons those kids will be fucked, some people actually do it for academic reasons and those kids have always been ok IMO.\n\n**EDIT** - Formatting issues...clearly homeschooling didn't help that much!",

      "text": "**This is not the average experience,** but it does happen.\n\nI was pulled out of 1st grade to be home-schooled, 'cause I was a weird gangly kid and none of the other children wanted fuck-all to do with me. It was probably because I was timid and wouldn't interact with anyone else.\n\nThen, there was my sister who is two years older than me. She was diagnosed as being severely autistic and had to be taken out of school for harming the other children (beating them up, and spitting on them were her favorite past-times).\n\nMy dad was supposed to be my teacher, and my mom was supposed to be my sister's caregiver. THAT DIDN'T FUCKING HAPPEN.\n\nInstead, I was neglected because my mom couldn't handle my sister, had to learn how to do basic survival skills (like making my own food, burnt myself more times than I can count), often ended up home alone while my parents took my sister to doctors... You get the picture? Yes, I'm bitter, because they refused to do anything for me. As a 6 year old.\n\nMy sister took over everything, and I was pushed into a corner. My dad would scream at me, tell me to \"teach myself,\" since evidently I was \"smart enough\" to do it, then hands me a high-school grade algebra book. *The fuck am I supposed to do with this?!* I never even learned multiplication!\n\n\nEventually my parents just acted like I wasn't even around. I'd disappear outside and hide in the woods for a few days, *anything* to get away from my fucking sister and my dipshit parents. Did they notice I was gone? Nope. I wasn't even on their radar.\n\nAfter a few years, when I was 10, we had to move across the country to live with my grandparents, because my sister's doctors had bankrupt us. My grandpa enrolled me in public school, and my mom threw the biggest tantrum I've ever seen, saying I wasn't their (grandparents) responsibility, that he was out of line for doing that... It got really bad. I never went to that school.\n\nThree years later my grandpa passed away. I still think it was from the stress of my parents fighting constantly and my sister smashing up everything in the house. Grandma kicked us all out after the funeral was over, said we weren't going to kill her like we'd killed grandpa.\n\nWe got into welfare housing a few streets down, and after a few weeks of being in a tiny apartment with a raging sibling who wanted to beat someone up, I lost it and just pummeled her into a wall. My dad punched me in the head and I passed out for what felt like an hour, but was only a few moments. There was screaming, blood, and I was kicked out.\n\nI went to my grandma's house, and I was only there for a day before my mom picked me up. I was treated like a prisoner from that day forward.\n\nMy parents and sister still live in that little apartment. I moved out the second I hit 18. It took me almost a week of fighting to get my relevant papers (birth certificate and SS card). I have no other identification.\n\nI'm 19 now and live in my grandma's house. She has restraining orders on my parents. I'm doing my best to teach myself what 3rd graders know. It's a struggle, but I've taken a liking to grammar and geography. :) Grandma found an old Nat Geo with a map of the world in it, and it's on my desk under a sheet of plexiglass.\n\nWow, that was really cathartic, getting all that out. I don't think I've ever told anyone all this before.",

      "text": "I'm 18. I've been homeschooled since 7th grade. And honestly...sometimes I wish people would just *shut up* about it. \n\nI don't mean the OP or anyone in this thread, just...it often seems like as soon as you say you're homeschooled, whoever you're talking to has already formed an opinion about it, which they will pontificate on at you if you're not lucky. I've known several other people who were homeschooled and they all had different reasons and ways of doing it. Just knowing that alone doesn't really indicate anything about the actual experience any more than someone saying they went to public school; in both cases you have a incredible range of possible experiences. \n\n*I* was homeschooled because the alternative was going to a horrible public school. My parents had both been fairly involved in the local middle and high schools. My dad is a therapist who helped kids there a lot and my mom did a lot of substitute teaching. My brother did his freshman year there before they pulled us both out. It's just so bad over there. They started one year without a principal. My brother went through something like four science teachers in one semester and apparently none of them taught anything; he came home one day and told us about a kid who had made a fireball by lighting a can of deodorant in the middle of class and the teacher just completely ignored it. Apparently the latest fad over there is making bomb threats because the kids know it will get them out of class without suffering any significant punishment. Hell, my elementary school was falling apart by the time I left, and they were still a cut above the rest of the county. \n\nI got more social interaction in my first few years of being homeschooled than I ever did while in school because I started working at a local theater. And this taught me an important lesson: that this entire county is a tight little clique of people who have been related to each other since the Civil War and they don't want anything to do with us. \n\nI mean, I can't say for sure, maybe if I had gone to school it would have all turned out great. Maybe I would've made lots of friends and had a great time. But the thing of it is, I met a lot of the kids who would have been my classmates. I even met some of the people who would have been my teachers. And the entire experience ended with me feeling miserable and rejected. I really can't imagine that highschool would've gone any better.\n\nI *wish* that I had had a good public school to go to. But I don't wish that I had not been homeschooled, because I have no reason to believe that that would have gone well in any way. My parents made the best decision they could have under the circumstances. \n\nI got a 28 on the ACT. I'm going to college in the fall. Honestly, I just want to get out of here and move on. I don't regard being homeschooled as any primary part of my identity. It's just another thing that happened.",

      "text": "I am currently nearing the end of a 6 year homeschool stint, forced upon me for medical reasons ([I have ME](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_fatigue_syndrome) ). I'm 16 btw. This september I will be going back into normal school for two years before uni. I definitely feel like it held me back socially, basically it turned me into an introvert. I was very outgoing before, now I have to fake it and \"learn\" how to be an extrovert again. I also have a relatively small number of friends, only one that I see more regularly than once a month and no girlfriend (but this is probably down to my medical problems rather than the fact that I'm homeschooled)\n\nOn the plus side, I feel like I am smarter than I would be if I had been in school, and I definitely know a lot more about all my subjects outside of what's in the textbooks than I would. I have done the same exams that you would if you were in school by the way, my parents aren't the kind of homeschoolers that hate exams. Revising for them also forced me to learn a ton of self-control, to force myself to put the work in when I could sit back and play games any time I wanted. It also gave me a lot of time to practice the piano, before I was homeschooled I was pretty bad, now I'm playing pieces concert pianists play (Rachmaninov Prelude Op.23 No5 for those interested).\n\nIf I had the choice, I would certainly do it all again, but without the medical problems. I feel it was mainly that which led to my lack of friends. I'm now planning to do Computer Science at Uni.",

      "text": "I went to kindergarten at a local private Christian school, then I was homeschooled through 8th grade.  I went to all 4 years of secondary at the local public high school.\n\nHomeschooling was never in the cards, but my sister had a really rough 3rd grade, so much so that my mom decided the best thing to do would be to bring her home.  My mom is a chemical engineer by schooling so science and math didn't scare her, and it just evolved into all 3 of us kids being homeschooled.  I had ADD and I was pretty smart for my age.  That equated to a sporadic academic schedule and getting to work way beyond my age in certain subjects.  But I got distracted easily, and a lot. \n\nSocially I think I did okay because I played on local sports teams, hung out occasionally with the neighborhood kids, and got involved with a local science museum that would allow homeschoolers to come volunteer one day a week as museum guides (COSI, in Columbus, OH).  We also joined a local homeschooling \"co-op\".  My mom knew nothing about state history, so when I was the right age I took that class as part of the co-op, and gained comparable knowledge to public school kids.\n\nOne of my favorite aspects of homeschooling was that we joined my dad on business trips all the time.  As a family, we visited every major city in every state between Michigan and Florida, and did schoolwork along the way.  It was a pretty fun childhood actually.\n\nBy the time my sister hit her sophomore year of high school she and my mom were fighting constantly.  My parents finally gave up and sent her to public school.  Her junior year was hell, she was socially awkward and had trouble fitting in.  By senior year she had found a clique and ended up okay.\n\nBased on that experience, my parents decided the best thing to do would be to send my brother and I to public school starting our freshman year.  Socially we did better than my sister.  I joined choir, played in a few sports, took some honors and AP courses.  The first year was difficult though, as I, the sheltered Christian homeschooler, thought I would be best friends with everyone I met.  The first cute girl I met in high school told me to \"shut the hell up\" (ended up as good friends by Senior year actually).  I really had no frame of reference for dealing with people that different from me, and that took some getting used to.  I was also pretty naive about girls, but at times that ended up working to my advantage.  The \"goody goody\" card got me into more than one girls pants. \n\nAcademically, homeschooling didn't hold me back.  I always tested well and went to a good college.  My bro and sis did fine too.\n\nThe one disclaimer I'd offer is that I know tons of homeschoolers that ended up screwy.  I know kids that were \"unschooled\", where no formal teaching ever occurred.  I know a kid that was brought home because his attention deficit was severe, but because his mother wasn't a therapist capable of helping him, he just got worse and worse.  I also have known people who were kept home and molested by their parents.  Clearly, there's a right and wrong way to do it.\n\nFinal note: I married a lifelong public schooler, who is now a public school teacher.  She is adamantly against homeschooling and that's fine with me.  It worked for where my family was at, but considering my wife's background, I trust her with this, and my kids will likely be public school all the way.\n\nEdited to add more detail....",

I enjoyed it, I didn't miss out on any social activities, I had normal friends (who went to public school) and I may have been a bit socially awkward, but that is because I am shy.\n\nI learned everything I would have in public school and more. I learned latin (as much as you can learn of a dead language) and spanish and a little french, my only shortcomings were in math. In fact, I was ahead in math by the time I was 9. I was doing grade 11 algebra because my brother was a math genius (still is - he's in university for engineering) and we worked on the same studies. I hated math, didn't get it all. I got so upset about it one day (because I didn't want to finish my math work) that I wrote a note to my mom and dad that basically said I was leaving, running away from home because I was a disappointment in math, and not to come look for me. My mom made cinnamon buns and said not to worry about it.\n\nGrade 9 was a write-off for \"highschool\" because I went to this ridiculously cult-ish christian private school, and got pulled out after it didn't work for me. \n\nWent to a catholic highschool the next year which was great, and I loved my highschool career after that. Science was always kind of a boring subject for me when I was homeschooled but I realized when I went to highschool that it was awesome and I loved it. Same with English, even math classes were ok. Social studies, geography, phys-ed, art, wood-shop, french, everything else was a breeze.\n\nI am not going to claim that I made a lot of friends in highschool, but the ones I did make are lifers.

      "text": "I was homeschooled from kindergarten through 8th grade due to growing up in an extremely remote location (Alaska).  It wasn't truly independent schooling; we went through an official state-run homeschooling program that sent out the curriculum and materials by mail and had you send back everything on a monthly basis for grading.  It required a great deal of parent involvement though, except for the last couple years.  My mother did most of the work (my dad's one of those \"see it once and know it forever\" people so he didn't have the patience to teach) and since she is an archaeologist and history nut I got a lot of \"extra\" education on those subjects.  Almost everything had to be written out by hand (we didn't have a computer until my last couple years doing it) so I gained phenomenal handwriting skills and a deep respect for the written word.  I was always a bookworm anyway, but having all your coursework be a read/write process definitely enhances reading comprehension.  I eventually went off to a state-run boarding school for high school, mostly because I had to basically teach myself everything in 8th grade (no discredit to my amazing parents, but really, how much High School math and other subjects do you remember in detail at 40?).\n\nOverall, it was a very valuable experience, and I wouldn't trade it for the world, but it definitely left me with some long-lasting social awkwardness.  I had basically had 1 or 2 friends my own age the whole time I was growing up, and I didn't even see them all that frequently since we lived so remotely I sometimes wouldn't see anyone other than my parents and the occasional neighbor for months at a time.  I generally got along with adults better than other kids.  The sudden transition from remote living to the crowded and rowdy boarding school environment was a huge culture shock, and then again when I went from there to a huge university after graduation.  I depended heavily on the internet and video games for a while, as bad as it sounds they're sort of a crash course in extreme social behaviour and are incredibly valuable when trying to normalize yourself from a solitary existence.\n\nThere were definitely some long-term effects, though I don't blame them on anyone but myself.  My parents did a fantastic job, and I credit their influence and parenting decisions with my fairly level-headed morality, love of reading and knowledge, and general sense of self-worth.  However, I have a lovely suite of social dysfunctions that I think largely stem from missing out on the middle-school social madness.  I still have a natural aversion to public events, I don't like answering phones, I don't like asking people for help, and am generally the Socially Awkward Penguin in most situations.  I have no problem talking to women, but have a hangup when it comes to showing interest.  You get the picture.\n\nAt 31, I think the benefits of homeschooling have greatly outstripped the drawbacks.  I'm smart, I'm literate, I have a pretty well-rounded knowledge base, and I can learn almost anything on my own.  I have fantastic friends that I value above all else.  The social stuff is easy to overcome with deliberate exposure.  I'm certainly worried that I won't be able to do as well with my own kids if I ever have any; I would challenge any parent to be as supportive and kind as mine.\n\nWould I recommend homeschooling for everyone?  No, certainly not, but I think with the right situation and educated parents who are completely committed to producing a well-rounded individual it can be a life-enriching experience.",

      "text": "I was home-schooled from fifth grade through my senior year of high school. I'm in college now studying biology and I feel like I've made the transition into college considerably smoother than many \"traditionally schooled\" students. I'm actually in the process of preparing a research poster on the subject of home schooled students in collegiate honors programs so I've talked to a fair amount of people about their experiences. \n\nOne of the key things to understand about homeschooling is that people do it for different reasons. Obviously religion is one of the big ones but there are also many people who believe that they can provide a better education for their child themselves than a public school can. In my families case it was a bit of both. My siblings and I were considerably ahead of our peers in school and consequently were bored a lot of the time (I usually read in class nonstop) but my family is also very strongly Catholic so my mother thought she could give better religious education as well.\n\nAcademically speaking I think that if the family is willing to put some effort into educating the child then it its usually superior to public school and often to private school. More importantly, since you can custom tailor a curriculum to the individual you can make it so that the students genuinely enjoy learning and school. I was able to take several classes that would have been impossible to take in the rural area where I live if I wasn't home schooled such as Japanese, Music Theory, Neuroscience and Philosophy.  \n\nI think that home schooled also imparts a greater feeling of academic independence in the student. For example in my junior and senior years of high school I essentially taught myself several subjects with just a textbook and a vague quota of work I needed done by the end of the year. I took anatomy like this and I also taught myself music theory and psychology independently. This was great preparation for the independence in college in my opinion and it has helped  me deal with the greater sense of independence in college.\n\nSocially speaking homeschooling varies a lot. It's easy for a person to be unsocialized or very socialized, it just takes work on the family's part. For example I was home schooled in a very rural remote area of Kentucky so we had to go out of our way for social opportunities. To this end I was in Scouting all throughout school (proud Eagle scout now, both my brothers are too) and I also had a good deal of involvement with a home school theater group. Finally my family also participated in co-ops were home schooled families would come together to teach and learn so I was with other people maybe 4 days a week. I know that's not a load but it was enough that neither I nor my siblings have had any problems at all being social.\n\nAnother social benefit of homeschooling is that for much of your formative years you are largely removed from peer pressure. I think its because of this that most of the home schooled students I know have a very strong sense of personal identity. They know who they are and what they think and believe.\n\nIf I had to rate my experience overall I'd say maybe 8.5 out of ten. You do miss out on some things but the benefits far outway the negatives.\n\nAs for religious homeschooling. I was part of a Catholic home school co-op for several years. And while they weren't as smart as the home schooled kids I knew that started to home school because they were gifted kids they were still more intelligent than most of my public school friends. They weren't crazy or super radical either though they were definitely very strong in their faith.\n\nTL;DR Homeschooling is fantastic as long as you are willing to work at it. It doesn't work if you are lazy about it.",

      "text": "I was home schooled from grade through high school. I went to preschool, and hated every second of it. My family was large & religious, and our local school district was terrible. My mother had a teaching certificate & used to sub (science), and decided that homeschooling was the way to go. Some years were better than others, she was pretty scheduled about it when we were young. We had desks, a set schedule, spelling bees, latin games & math contests. Kind of a one-room-school set up, and I enjoyed that. I always tested at well above average at that time. \n\nWe flirted with home school groups a little during that period, but lived out in the boonies, and mom was pregnant rather frequently, so we didn't have a ton of social interaction outside of church and swim/music lessons. \n\nWe moved to the suburbs when I was 12/13, and it was a bit of a shock. I was extremely introverted, and wanted to read books & ride horses. I had no interest in making friends, and had a difficult time talking to people. I did accidentally make friends with some other outcasts at church, and that was nice, but I still struggled to interact with most people. We got into various home school groups (loved the group classes! we had some great political science classes in particular), music (piano, band, choir), went to home school dances (pretty cool actually, most of the kids there were really fun), more church activities, got involved with a local stable, etc. Much more social overall. Most of which I hated - some kids were grounded, I was forced out of the house as punishment. \n\nMy parents adopted four more kids at that point, and our school work suffered for it. We were excepted to be self guided in many things, and self motivated in everything. Math made no sense whatsoever to me, algebra & geometry was incredibly difficult (still think its a brain issue as much as a teaching issue). Science was fine but reading the books and not actually doing anything was super boring, so I didn't really retain much. On top of that, some of our books were stupidly religious for no good reason. Crap my mother didn't even believe, but she'd heard the books were good and told us to use them without even a flip through. Incredibly sad in hindsight, as she was very good at science and could have really taught us a lot of she'd taken the time. English was no big deal, I read everything in sight and had no problem analyzing and regurgitating that information as needed. Same for history. Foreign language didn't happen. I still manged to pass the SAT's with a 1400 or so (mostly due to English and a few surprisingly good guesses at math), and started college at 16. \n\nThe work was no big deal, I settled in fairly well after the first semester and maintained a lazy b average (very little real studying happened, and first because I didn't really know how to study for a test, and then because I didn't care) throughout. Decent mid sized school. Nothing fancy, but they were the best school in the state for theatre (I went in for costume design, laugh if you wish, I was raised to be a good wife, not a career lady, and theatre interested me) so that worked out. \n\nSocially, college was very very very difficult. I went from a fairly sheltered life to being in the arts. With all of the drinking, drugs & sex the internet told me existed but I'd never really been around. Everyone was older and more outgoing than I was, and the adjustment was ridiculous. I was very quiet so people didn't realize (for the most part) just how awkward and uncomfortable I was, they generally assumed I was 20+ and thought they were stupid (ha! in reality I was deeply envious of their casual banter and ability to just make friends with others. And sell themselves as designers/whatever and actually get to do stuff...). By the time I graduated my social skills were much better, I had some fantastic friends, and learned a lot about balancing a social life as an introvert. Went on to grad school and had no problems there. \n\nNow I'm all grown up (more or less), running my own business, married (and making all the money. HA! Turns out I love being a career lady & not just a housewife), and pretty happy. I don't have much to do with my family (who got crazier every year), and left religion a long time ago. I'm capable of interacting in a normal level with people (handy as I work one-on-one with many clients!), and while I'm still uncomfortable in new social situations, its never too bad anymore. My social anxiety is nothing like it used to be. \n\nMy siblings close in age have varying degrees of the same story, and the youngest kids are in public school now. I think the first six of us turned out fine, but the schooling for the two older adopted children was shameful. Neither have, or will get, their GED. One has a blue collar career (no shame in that, but I feel bad that he doesn't really have a choice, though he's happy as a clam so I guess it worked out), and the other may or may not eventually settle down and do something useful with his life. My parents fucked them up rather thoroughly (socially they're fine, but religion & home school didn't do good things mentally). The younger adopted kids are in school, and I think will turn out ok. They're pretty socially normal, but have some English as a second language school struggles. The two younger blood siblings are fucked. Their schooling is a joke, they're extremely socially awkward, and I will be surprised if they make it to college. If they can get in they have a chance of learning appropriate social behavior and becoming normal, functional adults, but I'm not holding my breath. Its a shame as they are both quite intelligent. :/\n\nI would give my experience a 5 out of 10. It was fine, but not stellar. Some great points (horses! time to learn useful skills! excellent work ethic! got out of the house sooner!) , some notable downsides (social struggles! shameful holes in my learning! too much time with insane parents!). Public school would have been just as good or better than my home schooled experience, and I think my social skills would have been much better. Alas! \n\nEdit: For whatever its worth, I will not home school my own (theoretical) children. I want to send them to public school, we'll be involved in their education, and encourage learning and shit, but I have no interest in teaching. Home schooling can be great, but I think most of the time kids would be better off in public school with involved parents. We live in a world where mass education is the norm, and I think its useful for children to have that background when moving on to the \"real\" world. Life is hard enough without the stigma (and downsides in all too many cases) of homeschooling.",

      "text": "I was home schooled for all but 3rd grade (private school that year) and went to a public school for high school.  While home schooled I played soccer wherever we lived, and started running track/cross country in hs because my school didn't have a soccer program.  When I was growing up I hated being home schooled, never got along with my mom (who did most of the teaching), and couldn't stand not being around kids my own age.  We knew other families who home schooled around us and would get together with them, but no matter where we lived those families were predominately girls, so I still had no one to hang out with.  During the summers I would also go to a camp that my family has gone to for a long time (my dad and aunts went there when they were younger and my dad knows the people who run it now) so I got a lot of interaction then, but was always just a little slower socially then the other kids, and that was painfully obvious.\n\nAll those things made me learn how to be pretty independent and actually made me despise with a pretty heavy passion the \"jock\" stereotype or the people who would wear hollister or a&f, because the people who were always the meanest to me because I was different were the ones who fit those stereotypes.  I still won't wear either of those brands of clothing to this day, despite wearing nice clothes when I can, simply because they just doesn't feel right to me.\n\nThe hardest part for me was the fact that I simply hadn't matured as quickly as other people my age, and I think a lot of that was because I was not around other kids, and it always seems that other kids who are around their peers will mature together and quicker.  Of course my three younger siblings are also less mature than kids their own age, and my mom was the same way, so it could purely be a genetic thing.  Either way when I went to high school I still felt like I didn't look like I belonged because I looked so much younger than my classmates.  Luckily at that point I already had a few friends in my grade that I knew because my parents knew their parents by that point.  As time went on I grew up in a social aspect pretty quickly.  It helped that I was a really good long distance runner and by the time I was a junior was consistently top three in long distance running, and we won pretty much every week, so people liked me because I helped out with that.\n\nUp til now I've stuck to social aspects, because those are always the hardest to discuss or get over.  With actual learning I had great teachers.  My dad was a pastor at the time and had previously gotten a doctorate in law, and my mom had a degree in fashion merchandising (ton of math) and an associates in computer engineering.  My mom was also a stickler for grammar and proper word usage.  Both of my parents are very smart, and I have a lot of their tendencies for logic, reasoning, communication, etc.  Even when I attended the private school in third grade I was way ahead of my classmates, and in ninth grade I had a college level reading level, and only one other person in the high school consistently came close to me in that aspect.  I wasn't a 4.0 student or anything, but I was able to get to a lot of answers with simple logic and reasoning skills that my peers simply didn't have, and which I only got because of the curriculum my parents taught from and the extra books they used to teach us.\n\nCurrently I think there are a lot of advantages to home schooling, assuming the parents are actually up to the task of doing the job properly (as mine were).  The process needs to be balanced out with a pretty healthy dose of social interaction in some format though, which is not something I see in a lot of families.  As for me, I turned out just fine and am now married and graduated with my b.s. in anthropology last year.  I would actually gladly go back for a master's degree if I could afford it and could decide what I wanted it to be in.  One of my sisters is currently working towards a degree in food science from a big ten school before she goes to culinary school, and she was home schooled all through hs graduation.  I am glad to hear that my youngest brother and sister are going to a public high school next year though because I think it will suit their needs better.\n\ntl;dr- being home schooled isn't all that bad. academic advantages. if done properly there aren't any problems with becoming a functioning part of society.",

      "text": "I was both homeschooled and raised in a cultish church.  I went to a catholic elementary school for 4-5th grades, and a lutheran school for 6th.  I was picked on a lot, didn't have many friends at either school, and after night terrors the summer after 6th grade, my mom said she'd homeschool me again.\n\nMy mom did a decent job teaching me.  She knew she wasn't any good at math, and had my dad and grandpa help me with that when I had trouble.  I learned critical thinking skills very well, that's probably the best part of my education.  (Knowing *how* to think is more important than rote learning, I think.  How to ask questions, how to listen and decide, etc.  Probably a large part of why I ended up atheist after we left the cult.)  She didn't push me very hard, I could've learned more, if I'd had more motivation.  I wish I could get a do over for the last fifteen years or so of my life.  I passed all the tests, I learned things, and I did as little as she would let me get away with and spent a lot of time reading and playing video games or spending time outside.  Though honestly, I don't have enough knowledge about public schools to know if I would've done any better there.\n\nI went to a community college, not really knowing what I wanted to do.  I'd taught myself HTML as one of my classes, (she bought me a book I asked for) and decided maybe I'd go for computer graphics and web design.  I scored so high on the placement tests that the exam taker was startled.  (Perfect score in one, near-perfect on another, and a decent score on math.  I'd never gone past Algebra 2.)\n\nMost of my classes I was easily the smartest person in the room, some of them were boring.  I switched majors after a particularly unpleasant teacher was bitching about my lack of creativity in photoshop class.\n\nI took random classes next semester, including physics (cause it sounded interesting and I wanted to expand on my high-school class,) and welding.  Physics I aced.  After the first exam the teacher asked me why I was even in the class.  (I got a score in the mid-90's and was first one done by a lot, I guess, but I just paid attention and I read fast.)  At more than one point I corrected the teacher.\n\nI found welding interesting and got an associate's degree in welding technology.  I now work at a small manufacturing facility where I do welding, machining, assembly, photography, photoshoppery, web design, 3D precision CAD modeling, I'm half responsible for our inventory system, and I run the place when my manager's on vacation.\n\nI don't know how much academic success can be attributed to homeschooling over native ability, but I did end up doing quite well as far as general intelligence and critical thinking goes.  Whether or not I would've done better or worse in a public school setting, I have no idea.\n\nI'm now 30, and my social skills are retarded to the point where I still have basically 2 friends.  One of them actually from the lutheran school I went to in 6th grade, the manager in the above paragraph.  The other I met playing KoL, dated for a few years, now we're just friends.  The main problem there, I think, is the cult I was raised in. (I'm now atheist.)  Kind of a stealth cult.  You know how friends and family often point out \"you're in a cult, get out...\"?  Nobody ever realized, sadly.  My entire family left a few years ago.  The therapists we've all been seeing say \"yep, that's a cult\".  So probably things wouldn't've ended up much differently for me socially had I gone to a public school.  I had a bunch of acquaintances from community college, people from classes, people I played Magic with in the cafeteria between classes, but it never even occurred to me to keep in contact with them after I was done with school, because they didn't fit the profile of people my church said I could hang out with.  I didn't even realize that until a few months ago when my therapist pointed it out.\n\nTL;DR-  Ended up really smart, socially retarded, hard to tell what was from homeschooling, what was from the cult, what was from native ability.",

      "text": "I'm the oldest of eight kids and have been homeschooled my whole life. Our ages range from 19 to 5 with about two years between each child. I'm 19 and have not graduated Highschool. The last grade I FULLY finished was ninth. I am basically inept at math and struggle with science greatly. I'm gifted in english and history. Both of my parents are horrible at math and my father can't even do basic multiplication or division, and honestly it takes me far too long to do it. My mother did not play an active role in our schooling at all. We did thing with other homeschooled kids for two years then stopped. I have no friends in real life though I do have a few long distance friends I've only met online through reddit or some other outlet. I've had two best friends in my life when I was 4 and 7 but I moved and lost contact with both. Since then I've had no real friends at all. I was way over sheltered. I wasn't allowed to watch PG-13 movies at all till I was 17. When us oldest three girls were about 7 6 and 4 we were abused and had a very unhealthy life. We had limited internet access since I was about 12. All the computers were in the living room though so there was no privacy online. My father was insanely controlling and drove away every friend me, my siblings or mother ever had. I was abused physically a few times though both my parents deny it. Me and my sisters were not allowed to eat for up to 4 days at a time if we displeased my father at all. Sometimes my mother would sneak us a banana though if we began to cry of hunger because she disagreed with us being starved. She just didn't have the backbone to stand up to my father about it. We would receive \"spankings\" with a large leather belt( or thin springy twig from a small tree in the backyard that we would have to go pick ourselves) if we displeased either of our parents or fought with eachother. My siblings and I were almost totally unsupervised and because of the unhealthy home environment, our fathers examples of throwing us around, throwing things at us, grabbing us and brusing us, and the fact that we never went anywhere and therefore had no outlet for emotion were violent towards eachother. Me and my two sisters have scars everywhere on our bodies from attacking eachother. Scratching, clawing and biting eachother. My father was very harsh on us because he wanted a son and had three daughters instead. He worked long hours and my mother stayed home. We had a two story house and we were basically confined to the upstairs or backyard. We did not get bathed even once a week and our house was filthy and stank because of it. My grandmother was always surprised when we visited and some of us were bathed. We did not brush our teeth or hair or basically have any form of hygene at all. We rarely did school because our mother did not help us at all. It was all on the family computer and we basically knew if we didn't understand something then we would just have to fail because my mother had no idea how to teach us and was busy anyways with the new baby, my little brother. The son that my father wanted all along and basically shunned us for. Things got a little better till a year later when my other little brother was born, this time my father did not dote over him like he did our other brother, and was just as harsh with him as he was with us girls. We did our best to take the blame for things the younger kids did so they would be safe from spankings or not being allowed to eat. We tried to protect them from the things that we went trhough. Things got gradually better as me and my sisters grew older and our parents realised if we told outside authorities our home situation we would most likely be taken away. I have pretty much no idea what to do with my life at this point. I'm a attractive 19 year old girl, with no drivers license, friends, hardly an education. recently divorced parents, a full time working mom, a bum dad, and me and my sister are basically parents to all our younger sibling. I plan on joining the military and trying to go to college someday. All the kids but me my sister thats 17 and the baby whos 5 are now going to public school and doing well. The baby will be going to school this August. We all used to have crippling social skills. We went to a church for two years and not one of us was able to make a friend. We all got over it though and are really good with people now and all the kids have plenty of friends in school and are fairly popular. Most of them are a few grades behind because my parents stopped teaching us at all when their marriage started to fall apart when I was about 14. You would never be able to tell we went through all that just meeting us. I don't let my baggage show to people. That part of my life is gone and I gave up being angry or depressed about it awhile ago. I have a fantastic relationship with all my siblings. I love them more than anything in the world and would do anything for them. I'm very intelligent, just not eduacted like I'd like to be but I'm not planning on letting it ruin my life. This was very cathartic actually. To anyone who actually read this, I admire your dedication and hope I did not depress you lol.",

Basically, anything I did counted as a school course. I loved the PC, so I taught myself the basics of HTML, programming, and so on for credits. Read a book? Credits. Cook something? Credits. Learn to drive? Credits. By the end I was completing my actual book work in about 15 minutes (Math, science, history... Unravelling the mystery.).\n\nSocial contact was non-existent. No one ever believes me, but I truly had only one or two interactions with anyone near my age the whole time I was home schooled and for a number of years after ( age 14 - 20 roughly).\n\nWould I go back and do it again? No, I would have started being homeschooled from day 1. I don't think I'd go back through the school system. I have Aspergers Syndrome, which is supposedly why I had such a hard time in public school and why I excelled while homeschooled and in college (Online).\n\nToday, I'm 25 on the 12th, no real friends to speak of but one best friend from childhood, never had a girlfriend, and am currently unemployed. My education beyond homeschooling is quite good. Loads of community college classes under my belt related to IT. Moved to the UK with my Mother back in '08 and got a number of Microsoft qualifications here.\n\n**TL;DR**: Homeschool from 8th grade onward. Graduated at 17. Community College courses and Microsoft qualifications under my belt after Homeschooled. Unemployed, no friends, no girlfriend.

It was about the best experience I could have hoped for. \n\nI was in public school from kindergarten through 5th grade, homeschooled for 4 years, and reintegrated into a traditional schooling environment in 10th grade. I've suffered from social anxiety for most of my life, and by the end of 5th grade, the thought of going to middle school terrified the shit out of me, so I begged my mom to let me homeschool. She did some research and finally decided to pull me out of public school and give homeschooling a try. \n\nMy schooling during that period was nearly 100% self-directed, as my (single) mother worked full time. She did, however, put together a rock solid curriculum for me to follow, and she tested me in each subject regularly. \n\nI loved every minute of it. I was usually able to get my daily work done in less than 3 hours, and I spent the rest of the time playing video games and surfing the internet. I essentially taught myself math (through algebra II) by just reading the text books and doing the problem sets, and we had a mix of text books and computer programs to fill in the rest of the subjects (biology, general science, music, etc.). We even got dissection kits for biology (I never ended up using them, though, lol). For English, I was enrolled in a correspondence composition I course from a local university.\n\nCompared to public school, I felt completely free. I could study what I wanted, when I wanted, and as long as I passed my tests, I was free to spend my time however I liked.\n\nI eventually decided that I wanted to go back to a traditional school environment, as, obviously, my social interaction was pretty limited. We occasionally went to homeschool meet-ups where I could interact with other homeschooled kids, and that was okay, but I was still struggling with social anxiety issues, and I wanted to face them head on.\n\nWhen I got back in to traditional school, I had zero problems keeping up with the material (I had already done most of it). The social aspect, on the other hand, was a little more difficult. I still struggled with social anxiety and depression, but by the end of my senior year I was doing okay. I went into college feeling fully prepared both academically and socially.\n\nIn short, I don't think homeschooling held me back at all. From an academic standpoint, I achieved more while homeschooling than I think I would have in public school. From a social standpoint, I can't really say. My social anxiety was already holding me back in that regard, and I'm not sure middle school would have helped things. OTOH, I was only homeschooled for 4 years, and some of the kids I met through homeschool programs who had been homeschooled their entire lives did seem to be quite a bit behind in their social development.\n\nAs with anything, everyone has a different experience. I've seen homeschooled kids who come out just fine, and I've seen public-schooled kids who are completely fucked up. Everyone is different, and what works for one kid doesn't always work for everybody. That, I think, is the best aspect of homeschool, and I think it worked pretty well for me.",

Your argument is invalid. \n\nThe article you mention is specifically commenting on the 36% of home schooled children who were removed from public education for *religious reasons.* If I have learned anything from this thread it is that the religious and secular home schooling experiences are so different that judging them as a whole is apples and oranges.  Further, the reframe of the broader topic into \"languishing at home\" vs. public education is reductive and silly.\n\nYour last sentence implies inherent risk unless \"someone,\" presumably a government agent, monitors what is happening in the home. By the same reasoning, the government would be smart to read all of our emails and listen in on our phone conversations. Otherwise, who knows what we could be getting up to?",

You said yourself and told us you didn't want it to happen but your teenage sex-drive or possibly emotions towards your g/f (hopefully ex soon, honestly) let you go too far into a situation in which your g/f thought you were both past to point of no return. She can say that she \"thought\" you really wanted it all she wants to cover up her story, but from what I know your g/f is a stupid selfish whore who has little to no interest in YOUR well being. \n\nOkay I'm rambling so the moral of the story is yes you were sexually abused.

      "text": "Hi , this is Rosanna Smart from the panel -- thanks for the question(s)!\n\nCaveating that evidence here is relatively limited and the high degree of overlap between cannabis and tobacco smoking in many study populations makes it challenging to tease out respiratory effects specific to cannabis. As already noted in the replies, differences in the manner in which tobacco vs cannabis are smoked also likely relate to differences in their effects on respiratory function. Typically, smoking a joint involves deeper inhalation and longer breath-holding time; but a regular cannabis smoker smokes fewer joints per day than the number of cigarettes smoked by a regular cigarette smoker. We don‚Äôt have a lot of research to inform how these behavioral differences alone shake out to comparative respiratory risks.\n\nThat said, cannabis smoking is associated with respiratory issues including chronic bronchitis (cough, sputum, and wheezing), which seem to resolve when use is stopped (i.e., abstinence). Cannabis smoking has not been associated with incidence of lung cancer.  ([https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00952990.2019.1627366](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00952990.2019.1627366))\n\nWe know little about the short and long-term health consequences of vaporizing cannabis plant material or vape cartridges. Several studies have shown fewer self-reported respiratory symptoms among individuals who vaporize cannabis vs those who smoked.  A couple of early studies suggest that vaporizing \\***plant material**\\* may reduce the negative respiratory health effects associated with smoking cannabis ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20451365](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20451365)). Even less is known about cannabis / cannabinoid vape cartridges. This past year we learned that the vitamin E acetate additive in some vape cartridges were linked to severe respiratory illness ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31860793](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31860793))\n\nEvidence for bongs/water-pipes is also pretty thin ([https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0955395917303377](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0955395917303377)). Some research has shown filtered water-pipe/bongs are more effective at filtering out chemical residues from cannabis smoke but still yield a substantial amount of smoke-based pesticide residue; and other studies have found water-pipes and bongs to produce more tar and carbon monoxide than joints. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs much out there on how these different methods might translate into longer term effects on respiratory function.",

      "text": "Well, depending on how it's prepared, it will vary in bioavailability and composition, but it will almost likely be more potent per mg than smoking for a number of reasons. \n\nYou're not degrading cannabinoids into other stuff/destroying them, there's no smoke floating off with wasted cannabinoids, and your GI tract is more efficient in absorbing all the cannabinoids and terpenes. IIRC, THIS IS largely because it moves pretty slowly and that longer duration of contact with blood vessels allows for better bioavailability.\n\nHowever, you also have to contend with first-pass metabolism (occurs before the which also iirc, involves moving drugs through the portal vein to the liver where they are metabolized into other chemicals. Supposedly, you can bypass this a little by, say, eating a small snack so first-pass metabolism is a little less efficient and more goes to second pass where the mostly unaltered cannabinoids can get into your bloodstream, and travel about to activate CB1 & CB2 receptors in your body and brain. Of course you have to make sure it's only a small snack, otherwise it's liable to be diluted by the food, and not absorb as rapidly/efficiently.\n\nPart of the issue with edibles too is that they *can* be unpredictable, especially for beginners. I've had times when I thought I made something really strong that was actually pretty mild, and times where I had only a sliver of edible and I got absurdly baked and could only sleep in this weird quasi-psychedelic twilight. It sucked.\n\nAn empty or most empty stomach is ideal for edibles, especially when you're learning to titrate, i.e. figure out your dose.\n\nEdibles also feel a bit \"heavier\" than smoking it, and maybe that's from a better absorption of CBD relative to the THC and the more sedative cannabinoids, or perhaps just a bigger, more bioavailable dose, I'm not sure. My bet's on the latter though.\n\nThey can also take longer to kick in, but that's variable too. I've noticed an average of 1.5-3 hours for them to kick in, but there's been times when it took 8+, and a few times where I ate a weed-nuttella smore first thing in the morning and I felt pretty high after only like 15-20 minutes \n\nSmoking also involves a lot of burning plant material, which while less carcinogenic than cigarettes, is still definitely not ideal or healthy.\n\nEdibles and cannabis-infused drinks also have the advantage of being really delicious, especially when done right. If you don't like the spicy/earthy taste you can water cure the herb and get quite a lot of the taste/smell out of it. The smoke is nearly flavorless too (you know, besides smoke that is). The only problem with water curing is that you run the risk of developing mold if done poorly.\n\n(Btw, try bhang sometime, make it yourself of possible - it's an sweet, creamy, milky Indian weed smoothie type thing, and it's actually awesome even without the weed; also just throwing cannabutter into some turkey stuffing is surprisingly tasty - the spices and the weed flavor go together surprisingly well. Same thing with chocolate and chocolate/strawberry ice cream. Straight delicious.)\n\nA lot of this comes from reading Grasscity religiously as a high school stoner, but my memory is pretty decent. Hope this was useful info, and I hope I was accurate. Anyone who sees this, obviously please correct me if I'm wrong about anything.",

      "text": "Lisa Rice:  I fully concur with Richard Rothstein's comments re: school funding.  Spot on!\n\nI completely agree with other commentors that all schools must have adequate funding, healthy facilities, high-quality teaching and administration staffs, and ample resources to support our children's educational needs.  I also agree that we must fix major issues that help drive educational disparities, like not having [qualified educators](https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160225/upper-west-side/less-qualified-teachers-hinder-schools-with-black-latino-kids-report/) teaching subjects like English, Math, or Biology, or the [lack of diversity](https://whyy.org/articles/more-than-half-of-pa-public-schools-do-not-have-a-teacher-of-color/) among educators and administrative officials.  However, if we want all children to reach their potential, we cannot turn a blind eye to the major drivers of  inequality.\n\nThe challenges communities of color face are largely rooted in the legacy of residential segregation which is the bedrock of inequality.  In this nation, housing - where we live - is so central to issues like education, health and wealth because housing is inextricably linked to opportunity.  Yet when it comes to housing and lending opportunities in the U.S., we're a century behind where we need to be.  Our neighborhoods are more segregated today than they were 100 years ago.  The racial wealth and homeownership gaps are expanding.  In fact, the Black-White homeownership gap is now back to where it was in 1890.  \n\nBecause of segregation so much of our lives are impacted by the neighborhoods in which we live. That is because, through policies, legislation and housing/lending industry practices, as geographical areas became more populated with people of color -[by design](https://www.segregatedbydesign.com/) \\- these areas were subjected to extreme disinvestment and abuse.  The issues that plage them are systemic and not something that can be easily overcome by individual action.\n\nEducational disparities are not just a function of how much money we spend on an individual student or how much value a family might place on education.  How well a child can do in school is effected by a number of other things, like health, as Richard mentioned.  However, communities of color do not have the same access to healthcare as do predominately white neighborhoods.  The [National Fair  Housing Alliance](https://nationalfairhousing.org/) partnered with [Trulia](https://www.trulia.com/research/50-years-fair-housing/) to assess how well people are able to access quality healthcare based on where people live.  The study,  [50 Years After the Fair Housing Act ‚Äì Inequality Lingers](https://www.trulia.com/research/50-years-fair-housing/)*,* reveals that communities of color have almost 40% fewer healthcare establishments than majority-white areas.  For example, in Houston, majority-white communities have 27 healthcare facilities for every 100,000 people while majority-black communities have just 5 facilities for every 100,000 people.  \n\nGiven the [gaps in transportation access,](https://www.demos.org/research/move-thrive-public-transit-and-economic-opportunity-people-color) children of color face substantial obstacles in just trying to access quality healthcare services.  And then when they do get treatment, they face intentional or implicit bias.  Racial inequality is so baked into our society that even algorithmic systems designed to improve the quality of healthcare [generate bias against black patients](https://news.uchicago.edu/story/health-care-prediction-algorithm-biased-against-black-patients-study-finds).  \n\nChildren's health is also impacted by the built environments in which they live.  Unfortuantely, families of color are more likely to be impacted by environmental racism and injustice and are twice as likely to live in areas without potable water or proper sanitation.  Sometimes this is [because of discriminatory action](http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1822455,00.html).  At other times, it is a function of legacy issues that are hard to overcome.  Still, race is the most significant predictor of whether a person will live in a neighborhood with contaminated air, land or water and more than half those [living within 2 miles of a toxic waste facility are people of color.](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/race/news/2016/04/25/136361/5-things-to-know-about-communities-of-color-and-environmental-justice/)\n\nThese stark realities help explain the wide disparities we see from the COVID-19 pandemic.  And the pandemic will likely contribute to educational disparities in myriad ways.\n\nWhat this means is that remedies to overcome these challenges must be reparative, wide-based and systemic.  Just a few include:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Full enforcement of the Fair Housing Act's [Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing](https://nationalfairhousing.org/affh/) provision.  The Obama/Biden Administration promulgated an AFFH Rule in 2015 that provided resources, data and tools for municipalities to identify barriers to opportunity (including educational disparities) and then develop solutions for overcoming those impediments.  They also provided funding to help communities implement structural solutions (including support for programs and policies to close the education gap) that would significantly drive increased opportunities in under-resourced and racially segregated communities.  The Trump/Pence Administration has overturned that rule and removed funding for this initiative.  Yet there are promising signs that the initial infusion has been beneficial.\n* Retain critical tools for combating discrimination in the education, criminal justice, housing, voting, employment and lending sectors.  A major tool is the [Disparate Impact standard](https://www.defendcivilrights.org/).  Even leaders in the housing and financial services space are recognizing that by loosing this long-standing civil rights protection, we will erode what progress we have made.  In an astonishing move, major industry players [reversed their support of the Trump Administration's efforts](https://nationalfairhousing.org/2020/07/15/civil-rights-groups-commend-top%e2%80%afmortgage-lenders-industry-leaders-for-urging-hud-to-reconsider%e2%80%afdisparate-impact%e2%80%afrule/) to eliminate the Disparate Impact tool and have recently called on the Administration to halt its work to dismantle the tool.",

The average age for blacks is less than half that of the average age of whites. Older people will consume more healthcare and at greater cost. People over 65 consume so much more healthcare 1/3 of all healthcare dollars are spent on them. One might be tempted to say blacks have a lower age because fewer survive to old age due to inadequate care, which is likely part of it, but then homicide is the \\*number 4 killer\\* of blacks, when it doesn't even crack the top ten for whites. The top 3 killers of each have similar percentages of deaths due to it(heart disease, cancer, unintentional injuries), while a higher percentage of deaths from lower respiratory diseases is among than whites than blacks-conversely we see a higher percentage of deaths from diabetes from blacks than whites. These can arguably be attributed to lifestyles, as whites are more likely to smoke and blacks are more likely to have a diet conducive to getting diabetes.   \n\n\n\\> >Racial inequality is so baked into our society that even algorithmic systems designed to improve the quality of healthcare [generate bias against black patients](https://news.uchicago.edu/story/health-care-prediction-algorithm-biased-against-black-patients-study-finds). \n\nThe age question comes up again, but I tried to look into the study to see how they measured \"similar health level\" as the bias is claimed to be due to risk being based on cost of healthcare(hence the age concern), but it is behind a paywall.

People are not random events. For all manner of reasons including cultural ones, you don't see a uniform distribution of career aspirations. We don't see as many Asian majoring in public administration or political science as we do engineers and scientists either, so it would stand to reason that those choosing a career in education would also be influenced by those factors.   \n\n\nOne can argue the disparity in educational attainment(even though blacks are slightly overrepresented in college, at least among undergrads), but that doesn't change the fact that of those \\*who do\\* get higher education also have a disparity in their career choices.  \n\n\nThis is before considering the value of diversity itself, where while blacks are underrepresented among STEM PhDs, 1/3 of black STEM PhDs were earned at HBCUs, indicating that groups may be \\*self segregating\\* as they prefer areas that align more culturally with their own sensibilities and priorities. To what extent segregation is due to one's own volition or structural biases remains unclear, but we cannot simply assume any disparity of result must be due to unfair biases.",

In the charter school you might get 70-90% of involved parents, and even if 5/6 kids get rejected, if they end up in a classroom where 1/2 the kids have no support back home then everyone's learning will suffer as teachers are constantly occupied dealing with behavior problems that stem from either trauma in the home or lack of social development.\n\nI can see this with my own kids. I'm a poor but over-educated (i.e. in grad school) parent and my kids go to a public school in one of the worst districts in the nation. But they go to a school that takes more effort to go into, so in my daughter's class (about to be 2nd grade) maybe 2/3 of the kids have a lot of family support and stable  families and the other 1/3 are first generation refugees and such. The class overall works well because there are enough kids that can deal with being in a school environment OK. But I have friends teaching in other schools in the district where they have 80% of their 3rd grade students get handed a device with unlimited internet access when they get home, so they're talking about watching porn videos and R-rated slasher movies and have 0 discipline.\n\nOf course that's just \"anecdotal\" data, but in terms of explanatoriness that hypothesis seems to be rather strong.\n\nI still want to emphasize though: The fact that there might be a 'cultural' difference in parenting between poor black and affluent white communities would itself be a result of racist policies in the past. After all, if you literally can't advance your position by working hard, why would people in your community adapt 'hard work and discipline' as a value? And I'm not saying anything about the color of one's skin determines ones character - it obviously doesn't. \nIn the same way that if you keep getting mistreated by the police, you won't develop trust and deference to the police, so resisting or walking away from arrest, not talking to the police to try to clear up crimes, etc. becomes much more rational.\n If the only feasible way to get ahead seems to be through group networks like gangs, drug dealing, or hoping for an athletic scholarship and the structure of benefits discourages marriage, with a result of teenage pregnancies skyrocketing and thereby undermining stable families, that seems like a perfect storm to perpetuate poverty in some communities.",

As a white woman in the soft science of psychology, working as a mental health professional, I do wonder if the disparities are part of the intersectionality of systemic racism and classism for underrepresentation. \n\nStandardized IQ testing in this country, and in fact, personality testing and some other intensive measures for diagnosing a mental health disorder have roots in the modern eugenics movement in the United States. These measures being used today and non-inclusive to those without specific experiences due to the white-centering of ‚Äúnorms‚Äù is something I‚Äôve wondered about regarding BIPOC being dis included from college programs and higher education. Of course, this is already compounding the possibility of a disparity shaped by systems which have provided lack of funding, education, nutrition, etc that can break down these cycles and become more inclusive. \n\nThat‚Äôs the long way of asking: are the systems in place regarding standardized testing, education and access something that has been shown to lead to these gaps in representation in your fields?",

We haven't contributed any money to development of new water storage in about 30 years, while at the same time we have taken our water and put it toward environmental purposes. \n\nThe actual breakdown of our \"developed water\" (water we actually store) is about 40% ag, 40% environmental, and 20% everything else. 30 years ago, that number was more like 80% ag/ 20% environmental. Based on the numbers I've seen, ag has spent close to $3 billion dollars over the last 15 years to install drip in our fields. On my families farm, we fallowed 600 acres of drip tape fields because we didn't have water. \n\nAg is the most judicious user of water in the state. Do we have problems, such as unrestricted well drilling? Yes. And that is being addressed. But there are political decisions being made, such as the last 8 years where they have made poor decisions on water releases in an attempt to restore fish populations and just failed miserably. Last year, [in the worst water year in arguably 1,200 years](http://www.iflscience.com/environment/california-s-drought-likely-worst-1200-years), there was an attempt by the State Water Board to keep the fish population operating under \"normal conditions\". They ran short of water, by a weeks release, and the vast majority of the fish died. Attempting to do this has lost us somewhere between a million and a million and a half acre feet of water. \n\nI don't mean to highjack the AMA, but I'm happy to answer any questions to the best of my ability. \n\nedit: link updating. still looking around for some more.",

However there are many things to consider.  \n\nFirst, fish need good habitat in order to do well.  Habitat includes both biotic and abiotic factors (food and water essentially, with other stuff mixed in).  When you start degrading the habitat you lower the maximum number of fish the environment can support (referred to as a carrying capacity).  So the theory of a species rebounding after a catastrophic event is hugely dependent on the habitat avaliable for it to do so.\n\nDelta smelt are a small pelagic (open water) annual (typically lives for one year, but some females can live longer) species which forage on zooplankton.  Once a significant rain event occurs, and the water becomes very turbid, they will migrate into fresh water to spawn.  Larvae then hatch from the eggs, drift back down stream where they grow through the summer and do the whole thing over again in the winter.\n\nThey migrate all over, up to liberty island on the sacramento Deepwater ship channel, Montezuma slough in Suisun marsh, and occasionally into the Napa river if conditions are favorable.  The problem is that these fish just blindly follow the turbidity until they reach where ever it is they want to go.  \n\nWhat's starting to happen is that the habitat is continuing to degrade.  We've noticed a huge change in the zooplankton community.  mysid shrimp, Delta smelt preferred prey, have dropped out of the system almost completely, and now they forage on lower quality food.  We don't know why or how that happened.  Additionally, on the food note, when pumping is extreme rivers begin to flow north rto south, instead of East to west (to the ocean) and all of the Zooplankton that would be carried down to delta smelt juveniles is being sent south of the delta instead.\n\nWe also know that there is some mechanistic component of flow that somehow benefits smelt, maybe through food conveyance, maybe through spawning success, we don't really know.  But essentially we have to fix the habitat for them to even rebound.  2011 had a lot of water flowing out of the delta and into the bay, even in the fall months, and we saw a nice tick up in abundance that year.  So flow is important, we just aren't sure why or how.\n\nAdditionally, the rules of survival still apply regardless of carrying capacity.  So let's say you have a carrying capacity of 1000 individuals, and you have a survival rate of 2-3 % per clutch of eggs.  Your population dwindles to 10 fish (5 mating pairs) which produce 300 eggs each.  Apply the survival rate of 3% and that's going to be 45 fish the following year.  You see a rebound, but it still takes time, even under good conditions, to recover an annual species to the point of having hit the carrying capacity (in the absence of density dependence)\n\nAnd interestingly enough, you mention this year, Delta smelt had nothing to do with any pumping restrictions this year.  The smelt working group (a technical advice work team) made several recommendations which were never implemented and projects operated above what was even allowed in the biological opinions due to the drought.  Smelt were sucked up this year, but played no part in operation constraints.  In fact, US fish and wildlife even increased incidental take of the fish to more that twice what was allowed under the biological opinon to avoid any issues.\n\nAnyway, now I'm rambling.\n\nAll of the current restrictions are related to water management during a drought, and very little is being done for fish benefits.  Even though this means smelt aren't at risk of being sucked up, they still have to deal with high temperatures, low flows, poor food, and a low amount of abundance going into this year. Talks of extinction are real, and we aren't even sure what's cussing it outside of the fact you have a tremendous amount of water being removed from the system every year.

I get that data is constantly changing, but with this movie it just made me suspicious. \n\nI still wonder how these numbers have been determined. My guess is they go all the way up the totem with the total gallons used (water to give to animals, water to spray their food, water to clean them, etc..) to make the numbers seem more scary. \n\nThat being said, animal agriculture DOES use way too much water and we need to figure out ways to slow it down somehow.",

      "text": "Oh wow, big ol' question. The question that keeps me (and I'm sure Patrick) up at night. I'll try not to go into too much detail.   \nWe don't make the neutrino interaction models ourselves (thankfully, I used to be able to *math* as an undergrad, but... theory is so hard...). But none of the current 'models on the market' describe all of the observed data particularly well, so we suspect none of them are complete. One way we motivate interaction modelling errors is by comparing predictions of a range of plausible models and seeing where they differ, and how they differ from passed and current observations. Its not ideal, reality isn't just an 'average' of the models that theorists have yet come up with, but its a good start.\n\n**Models:** The very simplest models are actually quite concise, say order 100 Lines of Code. In an Undergrad particle physics course you might learn how to write down the formula for a neutrino hitting a neutron. The bit that we are wrestling with these days is that we don't have detectors made of 'free' neutrons, all of the particles that neutrinos interact with in our detectors are bound within atoms, and this changes things. We know it changes things because we can look at old data from the 70s, 80s and 90s when they did experiments with 'bubble chambers' that basically were just free protons (hydrogen) or a simple proton-neutron nucleus (deuterium), and then compare that to more recent data taken using carbon or water-based detectors, and the results are not well predicted by just scaling the 'free' model prediction up number of protons and neutrons in a carbon nucleus... So this is where the interaction theory community is today, trying to incorporate sophisticated models of the nucleus that nuclear theorists use for their own study into neutrino interaction models. Some of these models are amazingly sophisticated, and end up taken many hundreds of thousands of super computer CPU time to make predictions.\n\n**Other data:** We also look at observations of interactions from other experiments, specifically the MINERvA experiment at Fermilab ([https://minerva.fnal.gov/](https://minerva.fnal.gov/)), which was designed to make a wide range of measurements to produce data that sophisticated models can be compared to. Where models and observed data differ, we try to add some *ad hoc* errors to account for reasonable ways that such discrepancies could affect our oscillation results.\n\n**Analysis:** Ultimately, the way it works in the analysis of the data is that we ask the question: 'If we used model B instead of model A to analyze this data, would be get the same answer (or confidence level contours)?'. For all of the plausible models that we try on T2K, the answer is 'yes, pretty much', sometimes the exact positions of the results move, but not dramatically, and if they change perceptibly, then we expand our uncertainty to cover such a shift.\n\nBut its hard, and its getting harder because we can't sweep it all under the statistical rug any longer... we are collecting large samples of neutrino interactions. I'll leave the statistical analysis discussion to Patrick. Hope that begun to answer how we approach this huge and important topic.\n\n\\--Luke",

Thanks for participating in this discussion.\n\nSharing your data in a way that does not protect your privacy, will compromise the privacy of family members. Good point. If a person shared their data while protecting their own privacy, the protection would extend to family members. For instance at LunaDNA, a person's genomic or other personal data is never shared with others. Members control their own data.\n\nWhile our genetic makeup is impacted in combination by those who came before us, and while it will impact our offspring, it is still ours to control. We should be the ones making conscious and informed decisions about how our personal data is used. \n\nIts important to point out that DNA data has already saved countless lives through an improved understanding of cancer as a disease of our genome, through the identification of variants that predispose us to disease, and through the development of targeted drug therapies. In San Diego the Rady Children‚Äôs Institute for Genomic Medicine treats sick babies, infants, and children with early onset diseases.

These children in many cases would not live past the age of 5 years old without Rady's efforts to sequence the children, interpret their genome, and take appropriate action.\n\nThe more we understand how our genome, microbiome, environment, and our daily decisions impact our health and quality of life the better for all. This understanding requires a lot of people to share detailed personal data. Putting people at the center of this research and respecting their rights to privacy, transparency, shared rewards, and control will help to greatly accelerate discoveries.",

      "text": "I am a neuroscientist and a lot of my work straddles psychology and biology. When I started my PhD I was anxious to do work that had strong biological foundations; it seemed more \"real\" to me if a biological mechanism for a behavior could be shown.\n\nAfter spending a few years learning functional imaging I am firmly on the other side of the divide now. I think experimental brain imaging is almost (almost!) useless and we should save ourselves millions of dollars and a lot of headaches and replace almost (almost!) all fMRI studies with behavioral studies. Brain activity is used to infer behavioral effects where really we could save ourselves a lot of trouble by just measuring the behavior in the first place. \n\nThe best possible outcome of an fMRI study is usually: we hypothesized the X behavior activates Y brain region, and....we were right! What do you do with that information? Write a paper and move onto a different project. For instance, I discovered dysfunctional brain activity in one brain region in people who have a particular mental health condition. It's good to know, I guess, but it doesn't get us any closer to a treatment for that condition.\n\nSo, to bring it back to your title question: I think psychology's place is what it has always been -- to understand and explore human behavior, and to help adapt behaviors when they are maladaptive. And I think for the most part, psychology is more effective than biology at accomplishing all of that, despite being a \"softer\" science.\n\nOne final thought -- to anyone who disputes that psychology has produced anything of value, especially in recent years, I would direct them to the work that has been done in the last few decades on false memories and the fallibility of memory in general. In my opinion, this is one of the most significant contributions of psychology of all time given the implications for the legal system, and even for our personal lives and relationships.\n\nGreat question -- thanks for asking it.",

The basic idea is that we can analyse behavior on 3 levels: What is the meaning? What is the algorithm? And how is it implemented? \n\nI'll try to map that on what I understand an accountant is doing. You're looking at numbers. These numbers have a specific meaning. They tell you how the company is run, what's going on internally. A take home message could be 'Is a specific project on track'? That is the computational level. It gives you a 'gut feeling' about these things. If a colleague asks you about the status of that project, your first answer will probably not be '.25', but 'It's a bit over budget'. Making sure that the numbers are allright is not the end goal, but only a necessary one if the final statement about the state of affairs should be correct. The algorithmic level is 'How do we add up the numbers properly'. In the end, we want to have an instrument to steer projects, groups, companies in the right direction, but how we treat the numbers does matter. The implementational level would be 'I use Excel' vs 'I just add the numbers by hand'. Any algorithm has to be expressed physically eventually. You can't stay on an abstract level forever, at some point something has to happen in the physical world. This can be data on a computer or a written sheet of paper.\n\nNow, Psychology is concerned with the algorithmic level. What functions can we observe in behavior? How are items stored in memory? How are they retrieved? How do we judge the distance to an object far away? How do we judge the difference between the weight of two objects? Neuroscience is concerned with the implementation. How is this abstract function carried out in the brain? Remember,  algorithms have to go physical at some point, otherwise nothing happens. \n\nThe common problem of Neuroscience and Psychology is that we don't have much algorithms of behavior. The neuro people can see if something changes on the implementatinal level, that is in the brain. But they don't really know **why** it changes. We Psychologists can only see if the resulting behavior changes, but don't know what's happening on the brain level. Until we don't have functional theories of behavior, Psychology and Neuroscience won't be able to tell each other much.",

I never really understood the psychology isn't science argument unless someone thinks reading Freud is all you need to know about the field.

Though it isn't a huge sub focus in anthropology it has produced some great work. But while we readily adopt psychological evidence, anthropology in general still often critiques psychology for ignoring cross cultural research. The stereotype is a study with 300 New England undergrads being used to make claims about all humanity. Or starting from a behavior known to be specific to a culture and assuming it is just how all people behave/think/act (naive realism).\n\nHow wrong is that stereotype now? Do you study work like Marlowe's psych experiments with the Hadza and other cross cultural work like Kleinman, Lurhman, and Good?",

What's most unique about psychology (and the other social sciences) is that behavior is a complex subject that is often difficult to take direct measurements of.

Methods and instruments can change, but that impacts validity *individual* studies, not whether or not a discipline adheres to scientific method.

I know, it sounds weird, but here's an example. Once I was dog sitting a friend's dogs along with mine and some family came to the door. The friend dogs started barking, I opened the front door but not the screen, and they kept barking and kind of went berserk. I tried to command them to stop but they wouldn't. After a few tries my dog jumped in between them and the door, turned around and looked them right in the eyes and barked at them. I think there was also some body movement of some kind. Anyway, the other two dogs stopped barking at my family, paused briefly, and then their tails started wagging. Opened the door and we were all good. It was almost like my dog relayed to the others that we were all in the same pack and it was okay. To me this seems like advanced communications and I was shocked that dogs could communicate at that level. There have been other things that really made me question what animals are capable of as well. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on this?  What other similar \"teaching\" type behaviors have you noticed in animals?",

      "text": "I think you bring up some interesting points. It's true that there are many grey areas, but that's to expect when discussing any moral principle, even human rights (as you touched on when you wrote about people with mental disabilities, where you seem to suggest human rights is no absolute).\n\nI won't be able to address all the nuances of your argument, but I think much of it can be \"sidestepped\": Sure, there will always be some ambiguity concerning how much we ought to sacrifice to be kind/decent to others. And sure, almost everything we do is hurting *someone*, *somewhere*, *some* amount. But we don't have to be certain about the complicated cases to be certain about the not so complicated ones.\n\nI'd argue that killing animals for food/fur/ is actually **not**  one of the hard cases. We need only look at the [staggering number of animals that are slaugthered](http://i.imgur.com/5jUJQNp.gif?1) (keeping in mind that most of these are factory farm animals that we have reason to belief suffer a great deal) and look at what we humans get in return.\n\nYou bring up chocolate, but a more comparable example would be if all \"synthetic\" candy (not including dried fruit and such), as a food-group, turned out to be connected to what we have good reasons to believe is one of the greatest sources of suffering in the world. Should we then take steps to move away from that food group? (Keeping in mind, there are still sweet things to eat.) I think it's quite obvious we should.\n\nI don't think one could find many food-groups, or other categories of products, except animal products where the disparity between the utility we get (taste) and the amount of suffering someone else gets (billions of lives in factory farms) is so huge. So again, I really don't think this is one of the hard cases. \n\nAnd then I'm only counting the moral issue of the suffering. I think there is a convincing argument for the wrongness of killing too. When you compared the situation of mentally disabled people to those of animals, you conveniently stopped right before completing the analogy. We may be using mentally challanged peolpe in spurious ways, but  we would (and should) never breed mentally disabled people to be organ donors, to be sources of meat, or to be forced subjects of painful (and ultimately lethal) medical or cosmetic experiments. We recognize that suggesting building a whole industry around such practices would be one of the worst things we could do. But in as far as these individuals are comparable to farm animals (in regards to sentience), then I think we should be equally concerned about the two groups. Else we are not being consistent in our moral thinking. We are making convenient exceptions for animals where we would not do the same for an equivalent sentient being that happens to be human.\n\n...And then I haven't even mentioned the environmental issue of animal products, where animal agriculture time and again has been singled out as one of the biggest contributors of both environmental destruction and greenhouse gasses. \n\nAll in all, there are *so* many \"cons\" and so few \"pros\" that I, as I've said repeatedly now, can't really bring myself to see this as a hard question. In my view,  everyone that can, should at the very least take measures to reduce their consumption of animal products. As witnessed by a steadily growing population of both vegetarians and vegans, this is not half as hard as people like to imagine. (The common hyperbole \"I could never live without bacon/cheese/steak\" is just that: hyperbole.)\n\nI'm sorry if that came off as equal parts arguments, and equal parts ranting. I blame low blood-sugar (though not from lack of meat, haha!). Not sure I will have time to answer any more of your comments, if you should choose to reply. But I promise I will read anything you write back!",

Living on the Atlantic, I like to call it the Gulf Stream of the Pacific.  It will move most radioactivity offshore quickly and did, and now the first contaminants from 2011 are all the way across the 5000 or so miles of the Pacific.  That path is hardly uniform, but looks like snakes/jets, but levels will be lower for cesium the further you get along the current pathway.   \n\nSo the Kuroshio is doing its job, but you will have somewhat higher levels near Fukushima and Japan as long as the leaks continue (lower today by far than 2011, but still leaking).  What we measure today as close as 1 kilometer from the reactors is considered OK for swimming, boating, surfing, and we check this on every trip we make and when we sample the beaches.

      "text": "Hi Drs. Malcom, Smith, Posey, and Wilson.\n\nI have another question related measuring \"biases\" vs differences. I put biases in quotes here because in the measurement sciences, a bias *is* a statistical difference. What I mean here is \"problematic biases\" vs \"innate differences\" vs simple \"preferential differences\". This is easiest seen in the sexes, given that natural selection makes males and females sexually dimorphic, so we expect to see some differences between them, but also what motivates them and makes them happy might be statistically different regardless of nature vs environmental causes. My question is as follows:\n\n**How do you incorporate the sciences of different preferences into your analyses?**\n\nFor example, in [1] they find \"women express a stronger preference than men for occupations that are more valuable to society, which we hypothesize leads women to place a relatively greater weight than men on the occupational prestige of their occupation\", and in [2] this tendency appears even at choice of college major and what rewards females vs males prefer for accomplishments.\n\nThese preferences also relate to happiness. For example, in [3] they found \"that women have higher levels of well-being than men, with a few exceptions in low income countries\" and \"We conclude that differences in well-being across genders are affected by the same empirical and methodological factors that drive the paradoxes underlying income and well-being debates, with norms and expectations playing an important mediating role\".\n\nOne that particularly interests me is [4], where they find that men and women tend to chose even more different careers the more free they are to chose whatever they wish: \"It  is  proposed  that  heightened  levels  of  sexual dimorphism result from personality traits of men and women being less constrained and more able to naturally diverge in developed nations. In less fortunate social and economic conditions, innate personality differences between men and women may be attenuated.\"\n\nAnother interesting phenomenon appears to be the hypothesis that men tend to prefer \"things\" and women prefer \"people\" type fields, or as [5] puts more scientifically, \"The tendency of men to predominate in fields imposing high quantitative demands, high physical risk, and low social demands, and the tendency of women to be drawn to less quantitatively demanding fields, safer jobs, and jobs with a higher social content are, at least in part, artifacts of an evolutionary history that has left the human species with a sexually dimorphic mind. These differences are proximately mediated by sex hormones.\"\n\nOn the topic of sex hormones and their effects on motivations and tendencies, [6,7,8,9,10] find that prenatal exposure of the brain to testosterone shifts interests away from people toward inanimate objects, that brain exposure to testosterone contributes \"thing\" types of occupational choices even in women, and that these hormones even in utero predict the types of toys and occupations the person will chose.\n\nUltimately, I'm curious how you incorporate this science into your work, specifically differentiating what is a true difference in choices due to differences in biological phenomena or choices, and what are differences due to barriers (perceived or real), or other causes.\n\nThank you.\n\n[1] K.J.

Thank you for bringing up such a tricky topic to discuss, especially in the realm of scientific academia. \n\nHow do you think we should address biases against Asian scientists and researchers? I have particular concerns about biases coming from two areas:\n\n1) What are your thoughts on the [Wen Ho Lee](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/the_next_20/2016/09/the_case_of_scientist_wen_ho_lee_and_chinese_americans_under_suspicion_for.html) case and [other Chinese-born or ethnically Chinese scientists](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/11/feature-chinese-american-scientists-crosshairs) being unfairly targeted by the Department of Justice? It's extremely discouraging for lots of young Chinese-American scientists. I have heard from Masters' and PhD students who have decided that this uncertainty around Chinese scientists, coupled with all the hassle of immigration/greencards and staying in the US after graduation, affected their decision to go back to China/Taiwan. I don't know the situation for Muslim or other Asian American scientists/engineers, but I can't imagine it would be much better. It seems unfortunate that we're potentially losing some brilliant US-educated scientists because of this situation, and could you suggest solutions to this? \n\n2) This is perhaps a bit more difficult to bring up concrete evidence for, but as someone who has worked with and helped edit journal articles for Chinese and Chinese American scientists, I sensed that there is some fear among those with Chinese-sounding names that they would be dismissed by journals because of the reputation of Chinese \"paper mills\" and Chinese researchers faking scientific data. In my own anecdotal experience, I have felt that journal editors were a bit harsher in comments on researchers with Chinese names, and had a lower tolerance threshold for grammatical mistakes when they come from Chinese scientists. Regardless of whether this is real or perceived, it's an added source of anxiety for hard-working scientists with Chinese names who want to get published in legitimate journals and land tenure positions. Have you ever encountered this publishing bias before, and if so, what do you think should be done about possible discrimination from academic journals?",

One dimension often discussed in the sciences is gender. These gender studies also show differences in experiments and reality with regards to hiring. \n\nFor example, universities are trying to make up for the unequal balance in STEM and [experiments suggest faculty preference women over men for tenure track by 2:1](http://www.pnas.org/content/112/17/5360.short). But, tenure track doesn't mean tenured. People can spend their career as an associate/assistant professor despite promises of tenure being just around the corner. Nor, of course, do experiments always correctly reveal actual choices in the real world. \n\nA 2004 NSF study found that, ‚Äúwomen with eight or nine years of postdoctoral experience are about 5.9 percentage points less likely than men to be tenured. The comparable estimate for women with 14 or 15 years of experience is about 4.1 percentage points‚Äù. \n\nSimilarly, 2014 data from IPEDS shows that there are: \n\n\n\n Tenured Men | Tenured Women | Tenure Track Men | Tenure Track Women\n---|---|----|----\n161,285 | 98,052 | 51,176 | 48,615\n\nSo I'm curious: \n\n1. How do you measure racial bias and deal with the problems of experiment vs on the ground action results? \n2. How do you deal with the intersection of multiple variables? In other words, is focusing on race enough or do we need to also look at factors such as ethnicity, race, economic background, etc?",

      "text": "Hello, and thank you for this AMA!\n\nAs a biological anthropologist, race tends to be a central issue as we study human origins. Much of the coursework I both studied and taught has often professed to debunk the concept of race as scientific and biological. (If anyone is curious to know what I'm talking about, [visit here](http://www.understandingrace.org/home.html), [here](http://www.americananthro.org/ConnectWithAAA/Content.aspx?ItemNumber=2583), and [here!](http://www.livinganthropologically.com/anthropology/race-reconciled-debunks-race/))\n\nMy question relates to my personal experiences with other anthropologists (especially new ones just entering the field). I feel that many colleagues tend to think that \"anthropologists know better\" and therefore are not racist and don't fall victim to implicit bias (this is often the attitude with sexism as well). For example, a colleague of mine stated that it was too hard for anyone to be racist and sexist in anthropology. However, I've known people of color in the field who have expressed frustration with the academic system and people of color are still rare in the upper tiers (graduate programs and above). For example, at the cultural resources firm I work at we are all white, the vast majority of my departments that I worked in and was taught at were white, and most research is still conducted by white PhDs. I recently spoke with a former colleague who re-entered our graduate program and the ratio of the program now is 5 students of color to 20 students with white (generally affluent) American backgrounds.\n\nDo you find that a lot of scientists believe themselves to be enlightened and non-biased? Personally, I think this is a terrible problem in my field and counter productive to gaining actual diversity (thinking that we're already enlightened and therefore don't need to make strides to include students with different backgrounds). I think it even makes for some really bad science.* I know anthropologists who study human origins that completely disregard that their studies might be biased toward their point of view, or reinforce ideas that race is biological, but then refuse to revise or critique their work because they want to remain \"objective\" and not come across as PC. It can be frustrating to challenge those studies, because \"anthropologists aren't racist, we know better! And anyone who thinks this might have a bias is just being too sensitive.\" I am wondering if a lot of what I've experienced is perception, just limited to my field, or perhaps representative of a larger problem? What do you think would be a way to counter this?\n\n\n*I don't think this \"bad science\" is limited to anthropology, as the medical sciences are filled with scientific racism and biological concepts of race. I would love to hear thoughts on that as well.",

In a field with fewer women, the same people may be getting asked over and over again and are just opting out‚Ä¶ But I have heard of cases where conferences in the life sciences show the same skewing of speakers. In this case it is harder to make the case that ‚Äúwe can‚Äôt find any.‚Äù Or are different criteria being used? We will only invite superstar women and solid, but non-superstar men? We are all pushing to give you a bigger talent pool, but then they need opportunity.",

      "text": "The question of the value of political diversity is certainly worth discussing.  However, most of the research on political leanings of professors has focused on social sciences (and humanities), not STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, mathematics). \n\nHere's what [Gross and Simmons (2007)](http://www.conservativecriminology.com/uploads/5/6/1/7/56173731/gross_and_simmons_use.pdf) report on how professors in STEM fields identify on liberal--conservative spectrum:\n\n* Computer science and engineering: 11% liberal, 78% moderate, 11% conservative.\n\n* Health sciences: 20.5% liberal, 59% moderate, 20.5% conservative.\n \n* Physical and Biological sciences: 45% liberal, 47% moderate, 8% conservative.\n\nOnly in physical and biological sciences are there more professors who identify as liberal rather than conservative.  (Given that in the past two decades, \"conservatives\" have been identified closely with creationism and anti-climate-change attitudes, I am not surprised that scientists are reluctant to self-identify as \"conservative\".  I see similar reluctance among some scientists to self-identify as \"liberals\" because of prevalence of anti-GMO and anti-vaxxer movements.)\n\nFor party affiliation (keep in mind that [in 2007 among US adults, 33% identified as Democrat, and 25 as Republican](http://www.pewresearch.org/data-trend/political-attitudes/party-identification/)):\n\n* Computer science and engineering: 28% Democrat, 49% independent, 23% Republican.\n\n* Health sciences: 34% Democrat, 43% independent, 23% Republican.\n \n* Physical and Biological sciences: 54% Democrat, 32% independent, 15% Republican.\n\nAgain, only in physical and biological sciences is there a substantial deviation from the US population.  (Again, given the pandering of the Republican candidates towards creationists and climate-change deniers, I am hardly surprised.)",

      "text": "> being innately oriented towards more people-oriented pursuits\n\nThis particular claim isn't supported by your source. \n\nThe first source suggests:\n\n>A combination of factors reduces the proportion of women at each stage of a scientific career: the graduate-level environment; the maternal wall/glass ceiling; performance evaluation criteria; the lack of recognition; lack of support for leadership bids; and unconscious gender bias.\n\n[Here is a review of the literature on the gender wage gap](http://ftp.iza.org/dp9656.pdf)* that goes a bit into the \"STEM gap\":\n\n>Significantly, women continue to lag in the STEM (science,\ntechnology, engineering and mathematics) fields, particularly in mathematically-intensive fields (Ceci,\nGinther, Kahn, and Williams 2014). And gender differences in college major have been found to be an\nimportant determinant of the pay gap between college-educated men and women (Black, Haviland,\nSanders and Taylor 2008). \n\n>...\n\n>The male advantage at the upper end of math test scores has been cited as a\nfactor in the underrepresentation of women in STEM fields, although this contention has been the focus\nof considerable debate.^28 Of particular interest, a significant strand of recent research focuses on the\nsocial determinants of these differences and implicitly asks whether gender differences in math\nperformance may be influenced by educational policy and other environmental factors. \n\n-\n\n>Evidence that social influences matter comes from a variety of sources. For example, several\nstudies document considerable geographic variation in the gender gap in measured mathematics ability at\nthe mean and at the top levels of performance, both within the United States (Pope and Sydnor 2010) and\nacross countries (Guiso, Monte, Sapienza, and Zingales 2008; Fryer and Levitt 2010; Nollenberger,\nRodr√≠guez-Planas, and Sevilla 2014; Hoffman, Gneezy, and List 2011). In addition, the falling gender\ngap in math performance mentioned earlier also suggests that gender differences in math scores are\naffected by environmental factors. Moreover, the framing of the test can affect females‚Äô performance, as\nfound by Spencer, Steele, and Quinn‚Äôs (1999) research on stereotype threat: they found that women did\nas well as men on a difficult math test if they were told that men and women tended to do equally well;\nhowever, if women were told that women tend perform less well than men, then they did worse than men\non the test. And, in some cases, teachers may discriminate against girls in their assessment of math tests,\nas found by Lavy and Sand‚Äôs (2015) study of Israeli schools. \n\nSo whether the STEM gap is the result of innate differences between men and women, or environmental factors, or both, is still a question that is being studied.\n\n**Edit:** Added the survey I mentioned but didn't link before.

Women make up 50.6% of those receiving a Ph.D. in the sciences, but only 44.2% of junior science faculty positions and only 28% of senior faculty positions\". \n\nIs this meant to say that women are increasingly discriminated against as they climb the academic ladder? If so, did they consider the effect of past sexism when using this to point to current problems? Considering that the individuals who make up the senior faculty are older, of this group, what is the percent of women who held scientific bachelors degrees in the time period when they began their academic career? Even if the number was as high as it is now, how do we know the weeding out of women wasn't a past problem rather than a current one? If, say, women were heavily discriminated in access to graduate programs 20 years ago, we'd expect to see the effects of that in the senior faculty now. Is this adjusted for?",

In other words, people talk about the leaky STEM pipeline that \"leaks\" women because those jobs are often hostile to other things women want like families. Since women bear a significant time burden for families with pregnancy and post-pregnancy recovery, it is difficult to navigate if the workplace is not accommodating. But the reason it is difficult is cultural because those systems are cultural. Not because of an inherent biological bias that suddenly turns women into people who dislike their degrees.\n\n A chemistry experiment is not just the experiment - it is the grant writing, the grad students you have as workers, the lab, the teaching load, the write-up, the reviewers, the committee meetings, the advising, etc. that you also have to balance. People don't get to just do science on their own time with unlimited resources. \n\nAnd most business school studies suggest that people's satisfaction with their jobs is equally influenced by coworkers, boss/management, and interest/satisfaction with the work itself. Considering the many things you see about how difficult (and at times awful) academic career paths can be as well as the problems with non-academic STEM paths, how on earth do you sort out interest in scientific topic with the other stuff?",

There are epidemiological data suggesting that diabetics have an increased risk of Alzheimer‚Äôs dementia.  Then there‚Äôs a recent report that progression may be affected by immune cells gone awry in pruning brain neuronal connections (http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/03/over-pruning-synapses-may-drive-early-stage-alzheimer-s-disease?utm_source=sciencemagazine&utm_medium=facebook-text&utm_campaign=alzhapses-3369).  These observations both support this notion, but more research is needed to nail this down.  I‚Äôm excited by this line of investigation.\n\nWe hypothesize that medicines developed on the basis of genomic findings are more likely to be effective, are more likely to address causal factors (rather than symptoms), and side effects can be anticipated by looking for effects of the gene on other measures of health.  This is new and only become possible recently.  They are also likely to have great specificity, and could be used in individuals with genomic indications (personalized medicines).  Yes, such observation can frame new drug development (see http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1510926).  \n\nYour third query was about individually underpowered studies and meta-analysis.  The idea is that combining several / many underpowered studies by meta-analysis increases the power for discovery ‚Äì as if all the data were analyzed together.  Many meta-analysis efforts have put together 10‚Äôs or 100‚Äôs of thousands of observations, which has made it possible to detect the effects of variants whose marginal effectsizes are modest ‚Äì but whose discovery has provided profound insights into the underlying mechanisms and etiology of complex traits.",

It is the single most anti-democratic statement any sitting president has ever made. It should be immediately, forcefully and vocally repudiated by every conservative and Republican.\n\n>I do not write these words lightly. I have generally supported the Trump administration‚Äôs policies. Everyone has disagreements even with leaders of their own party, but I remain what I was before Trump was even a candidate ‚Äî a conservative Republican with populist leanings. Were this election solely a matter of Trump‚Äôs platform vs. former vice president Joe Biden‚Äôs, I would enthusiastically back the Trump agenda.\n\n>**Nor am I unaware of the anti-democratic elements among the far left. Mob violence and cancel culture are direct assaults on democracy and the rule of law, replacing the voice of the many with the force of the few. The timidity that too many leading Democrats have shown in the face of this summer‚Äôs onslaught on decency scares me, as it scares most Republicans I know. Freedom for me, but not for thee, is not America‚Äôs heritage.**\n\n>But Trump‚Äôs tweet jumps the shark in so many ways that it is impossible to ignore. Such a statement should be unthinkable (in fact, I assumed it was unthinkable, which is why I strongly criticized Biden in April when he claimed without evidence that Trump would try to delay the election).\n\n>No president has ever suggested that an election be delayed. We did not delay elections when the future of the nation was at stake during the Civil War and World War II. We did not delay the election in 1968 when urban riots were the norm, when the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy were assassinated, and when the Democratic National Convention broke down amid an anti-war riot outside the event that Chicago police brutally suppressed with tear gas and billy clubs. There is no need to even suggest delaying today, when most Americans can move freely and with three months to go before Election Day.\n\n>Trump‚Äôs stated cause for his suggestion, the purported fraudulent nature of mail-in balloting, is a spurious canard. Mail-in balloting does carry risks, but states have been using mass mail ballots for years with no incidences of significant voter fraud. Other nations, such as Australia, also employ mass mail balloting and have also not experienced mass fraud. A responsible approach to holding an election during the pandemic involves compromise on all sides but is easily obtained: Expand voting options, including expanded mail balloting and early in-person voting, and couple it with guarantees of security and safety such as requiring receipt of ballots by Election Day and a post office postmark on all ballots electoral officials receive. Trump‚Äôs refusal to even contemplate such an offer speaks volumes.\n\n>Fortunately, Trump has no power to delay the elections. The Constitution clearly establishes the length of terms for senators, representatives and the president. Those terms expire in early January 2021 and cannot be extended by law or executive order. The Constitution also establishes that only Congress can set the date of elections for a federal office and it has no jurisdiction over the times and dates for state and local elections. Trump‚Äôs gesture is as futile as it is dangerous.\n\n>Nonetheless, his tweet strikes at the heart of American democracy and therefore must be instantly repudiated. Republicans should be among the leaders in denouncing his call. Not long after the tweet, The Post reported that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) had this to say: ‚Äú'Never in the history of the country, through wars, depressions and the Civil War, have we ever not had a federally scheduled election on time,‚Äù McConnell said in a television interview with Georgia NBC affiliate WNKY. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll find a way to do that again this Nov. 3.'‚Äù\n\n>But Republicans should do more. McConnell and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) should jointly introduce a nonbinding resolution in their respective chambers reiterating that it is the will of Congress that elections occur on Nov. 3 as scheduled. This resolution should be supported by every Republican member of each chamber, regardless of their beliefs on mail-in balloting. This resolution would immediately distinguish Trump from his party, to the latter‚Äôs advantage.\n\n>Vice President Pence should also distance himself. He is constitutionally protected as vice president; he is the administration member who cannot be fired. His statement would be especially important because he has been a dutiful lieutenant, rarely if ever uttering a word disputing Trump. He should dispel any worries that Trump would dump him from the ticket in retaliation. Were that to happen, it would only enhance Pence‚Äôs stature and secure his political future.\n\n>Abraham Lincoln despaired of reelection in the summer of 1864. Union armies were stuck outside Atlanta and Richmond, and the public was tired of bloody stalemate. His Democratic opponent, former general George McClellan, stood on a platform of peace and negotiation with the Confederacy. Yet our greatest president never contemplated delaying that fall‚Äôs election, even though as late as Aug. 23, 1864, he felt certain that he would lose. Today‚Äôs Republicans should follow the course set by the first Republican president, embracing our democratic heritage and rejecting the fevered musings emanating from the Oval Office.\n\nNote the bold paragraph.\n\nBefore he truly addresses the headline, he makes sure to take shots at the \"far left.\" He's effectively equating the words of the president - leader of the Republican party - to unnamed \"far left\" opinions, as if they hold equal weight. He stops short of saying Biden was right, and he makes it clear that he still backs the president.\n\nGood on him for calling out the president here, but it's far from a retraction. He's not admitting that he was wrong, and he doesn't apologize to Biden.\n\nHis tweet before posting the article is even more telling: [source](https://twitter.com/henryolseneppc/status/1288897028626489344?s=21).\n\nHe doubles down on his original claim. The fact that Trump did this means Biden's claim was *absolutely not unfounded*. Biden was right, full stop.",

      "text": "No offense, but this response is not for you, it's for everyone reading your comment.  I know that you won't be swayed by what I have to say, but the other readers here have a right to know the truth that you are obfuscating.\n\nHillary's donations from the Fossil Fuels industry aren't a problem of legality or legitimacy, it is a problem of policy coherence, consistency and trust.  The American people have trusted politicians in the past who accepted money from large business interests and had that trust betrayed.  Hillary says that she will act aggressively to move this country away from fossil fuels and toward clean energy, but she still supports questionable energy resources (such as fracking), and accepts large amounts of money from the Fossil Fuel industry.\n\nSpecifically, the donations that she has accepted are as follows:\n\n* $307,561 from Oil and Gas industry workers - This is the portion that you and other Hillary supporters continue to refer to as if it is they are the only donations she has accepted, and these are the type of donations that Sanders also accepts.  They are typically considered acceptable.  After all, if we started actively inhibiting donations based on company of employment, that would become highly discriminatory.\n\n* $1.5 Million in \"bundled\" donations from Oil and Gas industry lobbyists - These are donations from fundraisers held by various companies and organizations that ask each individual in attendance to donate a set amount and then the total is granted to the candidate's campaign.  This is a way for lobbyists to stack up large donations for a cause they support while staying within the campaign contribution limit.  Roughly fourty registered gas and oil lobbyists, many of whom worked in the fossil fuels industry at some point, have continued to bundle donations to Clinton's campaign.  This practice is not illegal, but is questionable, as it is money raised directly by the lobbyists she would be expected to oppose in order to keep her campaign promises.\n\n* $4.25 Million additional donated to Hillary Clinton's Priorities Action USA Super PAC by both Fossil Fuel industry lobbyists and investors - These are particularly questionable because investors typically put their money in places where they expect to get money back.  The only way an investor would see Hillary Clinton's campaign as a worthwhile investment is if they believe her actions as president of the united states will win them more money than they donated.  The defense of these donations is that they are not illegal and Hillary Clinton has no direct control over her super PACs.  It is a defense that is shaky at best because she has the ability to reject any Super PAC that wishes to support her campaign, or to ask them to stop accepting donations from industries she says that she opposes.\n\nWhen looked at through Rose-Colored Glasses, these donations are all acceptable because they're legal, because Clinton signed no contract promising leniency to the donors, and because Republicans do it, too.  The reality, however, is that Hillary Clinton is not currently facing a Republican opponent, she's facing Bernie Sanders.  Sanders has only received $53,760 in individual contributions from employees of the Fossil Fuels industry, he has rejected bundled donations and he has rejected super PACs in order to back up his rhetoric with action.  Hillary Clinton could choose to do the same.  She has not.  You can read more about the democratic candidates' donations from the Fossil Fuels industry in the [Politifact article here.](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/apr/01/sorting-out-clintons-fossil-fuel-contributions/)\n\nFurthermore, the American people have supported candidates in the past that accepted contributions from industries they professed opposition to, only to see lackluster results at best.  Obama is a prime example of this.  He accepted millions in donations from the banking industry for his campaign and during his presidency no banker has been prosecuted for the egregious amounts of fraud, money laundering, and other white collar crimes they committed.  The repercussions to the companies whose executives committed those crimes have been so negligible that they barely ate into the companies' profit margins, and before the retort is made that Obama does not directly control the regulatory commissions and government organizations expected to regulate those corporations, consider first that he appointed their chairmen.  Dodd-Frank is a powerful piece of legislation passed under his administration, but it by itself it is not a regulation on the finance industries.  The efficacy of Dodd-Frank is dependent upon the current administration assessing that a financial institution constitutes a risk and choosing to take action against it.  The American people believe that the big banks are a risk, but the administration does not agree and refuses to act, thus Dodd-Frank has failed in its purpose, and thus we see the importance of supporting a candidate who not only states their opposition to an industry, but also demonstrates that opposition.  Bernie Sanders does this.  Hillary Clinton does not, and attempting to dodge or obfuscate that fact only empowers the argument against her.",

      "text": "Hi Mike!  \n\nIt's awesome that you're running for office and I wholeheartedly support he ideas of a single payer system and free college.  However, I'm also acutely aware of the costs.  Some of the other questions and replies addressed them, but I was hoping you might be able to clarify something for me.\n\nWhen you say \"single payer\" do you mean no other private insurance or do you mean single layer like other systems around the world (Canada, UK, Swiss, etc) with augmented insurance coverage?  I ask because other nations face rationing and don't consume healthcare at nearly the levels we do (doctors [overprescribing at patient request](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/26633255/) for example).  If there is supplemental coverage, what stops the government from saying a really expensive drug like Sovaldi won't be covered anymore because of the billions needed?  And if there is supplemental insurance, that problem get magnified and the federal govt loses a lot of negotiating power (people need medicine, force them to buy private insurance for it, go broke, etc).\n\nThe [CMS](https://www.cms.gov/research-statistics-data-and-systems/statistics-trends-and-reports/nationalhealthexpenddata/nhe-fact-sheet.html) gives us a lot of healthcare cost data, so with healthcare and copays/deductible coverage (I assume that's part of the plan?), we're looking at another $1.5-2 trillion in outlays.  If we save $500 billion, that's still a huge chunk we're on the hook for.  \n\nAdditional saving can be had by cutting out the middle man, but we're also talking about taking on overhead the federal govt isn't prepared for.  The IRS is understaffed and CMS will face an even worse predicament IMO.\n\nThat's not to say I think it's a bad idea to go single payer.  I don't, but I do think we need to address underlying healthcare costs before we go there.  Otherwise it will have a lot of undesirable effects on the economy.  \n\nWhat's your take on all that?  Are there underlying costs you think need to be addressed (is, the \"why's\" that explain increasing costs)?",

Also, advanced calculus teachers have an easier job than a kindergarten teacher in some ways, such as being responsible for teaching two or three different classes, or preps, per day, whereas a kindergarten teacher is responsible for teaching all subjects as well as teaching remedial basic human behavior skills.  The idea of the pay scale is that you're supposed to improve your practice each year, and those who do not meet expectations move on to different carreers or are let go.  In my experience, the vast majority of teachers are extremely hard working anddedicated (to the point of martyrdom).\n\nI think you may have been referencing merit pay for teachers, where the teachers whose classes perform best on standardized tests receive more money.  There are two huge flaws in this system.  1) This system invalidates one integral part of learning; the student.  Teaching is not installing knowledge, it is like a doctor giving health advice.  If the patient fails to take their medicine, or make good lifestyle choices, they will have poor health.  Should we reward doctors who find motivated patients?  2) Typically only the \"important\" subjects are eligable for merit pay, like math and science.  I am a music teacher.  I have both a bachelor's and master's degree and I have passed the riduclous test to receive my certification.  I work the same hours, plan units and lessons using nationally recognized standards.  Rewarding math and science sends the message that all other areas of study are not valuable, and that certain employees are elite by virtue of thier choice of expertise.\n\nThere is already merit pay built into our pay scale; more education = more money.  The teachers who, in their free time, take classes and receive college credits move to higher pay scales.  I don't know how else you could reliably do it.  \n\nAccolades or complaints from parents?  What if you have a beligerent, crazy parent who does nothing but complain?  What if you have a high low-income population in your class, causing many parents to be too busy working to be active in their child's school life?  What if a teacher has a buddy with a child in their class?  This system will base teacher pay based on quality the parenting of their students. This doesn't make sense.",

Especially because of the title rule being eased up a little, people who put (or forget to remove, in case of \"suggested title\") the site's name from the post title shouldn't have their submission removed. You may say you recommend people not use the suggest title feature, but you'll never completely eliminate people doing so.\n\n2. There needs to be a better system for when a duplicate article isn't really a duplicate. Oftentimes, large publications will update or even overhaul a story, headline and all, without changing the URL. It could be a day or two later, but the updated version with the updated post title will still get removed by the bot. All this does is hide new developments.",

      "text": "> Fox was quite helpful, especially given your refusal to accept the many explanations that were given to you over the course of three (!) different metathreads and continued demands for special treatment.\n\nThis is disingenuous as best. The first time, I got a \"I'll look into it.\" The second time, I didn't receive a response because the mod was blocked for a previous inappropriate comment. The third time I had the entire post removed by automod, with it not being reinstated for multiple days. If that classifies as special treatment, it explains your absolute lack of response for everyone else in this thread. I wasn't going to accept the responses that twisted the words of the original mod explanation. The \"what the mod MEANT was...\" defense doesn't work.\n\n> I think we've given you the most comprehensive and in-depth explanation ever of why a particular off-topic submission was removed. If you're still not satisfied, there's nothing more we can do about it, except recommend subscribing to other communities that more closely match your expectations.\n\nAhh, the old \"my authority trumps everything\" card. Very classy. Would you like to comment on Fox's inappropriate conduct from the previous time I tried to post this message? Maybe comment on him refusing to put the comment back up? How about him going to a movie instead of helping me? Perhaps the gas-lighting, despite picture evidence? If you honestly see *nothing* wrong at this point, perhaps you should resign from your position of authority. It's just not working.\n\n> We consider this issue resolved.\n\nNeat, I don't. I'll continue bringing it up at all of the meta-threads (assuming there is another after this 6-month hiatus).\n\n> I understand that it's disappointing that you didn't get the resolution you wanted, but that's how it is.\n\nI understand you want to stop all over your users, but don't be surprised when people get upset. If this would all fit into that new Pikachu meme going around.\n\n>Mods refuse to respond, act passive aggressive.\n\n>>Users are unhappy.\n\n>>>[Mods.](https://i.redd.it/xmulu1f6urt11.jpg)\n\nFinally, I ask you go through your user feedback, and *honestly, truly* evaluate how happy people are. The last metathread was an absolutely shitshow in terms of people being unhappy with the mods, and this metathread is no different. If you're going to continue the status-quo, don't be surprised when people become (and remain) upset. I know this isn't the reaction you wanted, but that's how it is.",

      "text": "> How does that change the timing calculus. \n\nThe way I'm reading this, the two year timing only applies to \"persons.\"  For example: If you are a sole proprietor, you would satisfy the restriction of \"moving\" more than 50% of your workforce if  you move 1 person. 100%. If you are such a person and you did any work in WI before then in 2 years you are excluded. The 2 year exclusion does **not** apply for \"businesses\" that are not S-corp, LLC, or Partnerships. \n\n> And I'm still bothered by the fact that this isn't unique at all to prisons.\n\nSorry that wasn't my point and I agree - I **don't** view the acts as evidence of a prison play. I mainly included the text Acts to back up the \"a budget crisis\" claims which have gone back and forth and back and forth on reddit ad-nausium. I wanted to know - \"who had the facts?\" I concluded it was Maddow/Rhodes. \n\nSo where did the DoC takeover thought come from? I think the best predictor of future behavior is past behavior. The link between is evidenced in the political donations he's gotten and the acts he's taken to fire workers and replace them with Wackenhut (in some cases Wackenhut just re-hired them). Again NOT the acts. \n\n> Why can we infer the government intends to privatize its prisons just because it made it possible for any MNC to come into the state a bit easier?\n\nWe can't. I'd not make such a claim. \n\nThe acts just handed Walker the ability to claim a fiscal emergency instead of faking it like he did before as found in the lawsuit/arbitration. That's why I linked to Act 1 which has NOTHING to do with Wackenhut. Just the \"crisis\" and pointing out that they were written to back-date the tax's effects.

So if a company has high turnover for say a data analyst role they may have hired 2 or 3 analyst for the same &quot;seat&quot; within the company.  Meta might have hired 120 Data Scientists but if they are losing people because of burnout it may be a misleading number.  Great video by the way.",

I  watched a Free youtube bootcamp from Alex the analyst and even finished it.<br><br>But Later I stumbled upon BI analyst which is very similar to Data Analyst although I find BI more interesting and thus continued my journey in a different path. <br><br>Currently I am taking a udemy course , and honestly there is still so much to learn and relearn.  <br><br>But well, Ill keep sharing my journey here time to time.",

The more accurate way to put it is that AI will reduce the number of jobs in certain fields. It won‚Äôt necessarily replace analysts, for example, but it will make them much more efficient. This means companies might need fewer analysts overall because the ones they have will be able to handle a lot more work in the same 9-to-5 schedule. So, it‚Äôs less about AI taking over and more about it changing the way we work.",
