Sure thing the desktop PC would have more capability for having more TDP so you basically overpowered the laptop with the exact same spec, say it both got ryzen 5600 and RTX 3060, due to minimum size of the chips and lack of breathing area, laptop needs to set the TDP and TGP lower.<br><br>But then again desktop PC needs more components to consider, like a case, fans, power supply, monitor, keyboard and mouse. These aspects could cause the price to performance to a lost cause compared to just buying a gaming laptop like you do.<br><br>For the ongoing income, gaming laptop is absolutely winning for having much lower power consumption to measure your electric bill and you can charge it even in McDonald&#39;s for free.",

Laptop companies fill them to the brim with bloatware meant to make it super slow after a couple years, not to mention how in general it gets more dusty. There is literally no upgrade paths because the chips are soldered on, and the battery gets worse over time. When it comes to longevity it’s not even a question. My pc vs my brothers gaming laptop (we bought same price same time) mine is still running like a beast and he has been complaining about his for over a year now. And I haven’t even upgraded yet which I can easily do because I got a high wattage psu and I’m on the am4 platform",

To think that you equate my original comment to someone making a meme about consoles shows how hard you lack any sort of nuance.

From experience, a nice way to ‘usually’ get a decent deal on a laptop, find one you want, and buy a version with less RAM. Getting RAM separately and upgrading it yourself usually is cheaper. Could also be done with adding your own storage with a smaller starting storage. 👍",

The 4050 on this laptop doesn&#39;t use as much power as other 4050 laptops for the reason so the performance is drastically lower, sometimes even only half as good as other 4050. They did this to fix the heat problem but the 90°C come from the cpu lol. This laptop isn&#39;t that bad if it&#39;s just for casual use but other 4050 laptops are miles better albeit few hundred bucks more expensive. The only laptop I can think of equally bad is the MSI GF63-thin 2023 for the similar price, maybe the GF one is slightly worse (I haven&#39;t seen enough reviews on that laptop) so this one is the second worst 4050 I guess",

I&#39;d argue if someone wants to play starfield, they&#39;re better off getting an older laptop with something like a 3070 or higher. It&#39;ll probably be cheaper but provide more performance, although I&#39;m not sure how much of a boost Frame Generation would bring to the 4050.",

(Skip to the last sentence for the GPU you should settle with)<br><br>I&#39;d say the difference between the RTX 4070 and 5070 is around 15-30%. Kinda big difference, the 5070 gives more FPS (around 20-40 more) in 1440p then the 4070. If you don&#39;t want too much info, I&#39;d say you just go with the 5070. But, RTX 5070, being newer, it might be priced higher due to demand. <br><br>Both can run AAA games around 70-100 FPS but may start struggling. If you have the budget. get a 4080 (Ohoh buddy, 5080 will be priced absurdly) if your planning to play heavy AAA games.<br><br>And about the 4060, yeah don&#39;t get it, 4070 or 5070 is much better in my opinion. <br><br>Overall, get the 5070, tighter budget or absurd prices? Get the 4070. Hevay games? RTX 4080 it is.",

Honestly you’ll be fine with any 16-32gb ram laptops you without a GPU if you’re on a budget, but it doesn’t hurt to have.

Should i get a small gaming keyboard or is the laptop keyboard fine? Is the logitech G305 a good budget gaming mouse? Should i get a cooling pad? What are the risks of having an external keyboard and mouse in my bag? And I’m getting the acer nitro 16 4070, 1tb, R7-8HS if you’re wondering. And I’m happy to take more advice :)",

      "text": "Instead of this laptop i think Lenovo&#39;s LOQ series is better (specifically the i5 13450HX RTX 4050 with upto 105w tgp model of the laptop) if we compare by specs and cost to performance ratio since it has rtx 4050 instead of 3050 and also has almost equivalent tgp like the laptop shown in this video. I dont know if the LOQ series have good thermals or no (even though they said that they have made the thermals better than the prev. Gen) but winters are gonna come soon and it is recommended to use a gaming laptop with a cooling pad so in those conditions i think it will be a better choice👍",

The batteries will be checked for damage, tested and, if necessary, harvested for precious materials, otherwise they'll be restocked to be used more intelligently in a different device. The other internal components will likely be saved for a low-cost model next year. I'm willing to bet they'll be looking for some way to repurpose the case, too.\n\nThe Note 7's problem likely isn't specifically with any particular component. The problem was caused by an oversight in the design, probably relating to differences between prototyping and mass-manufacturing processes. Throwing the whole lot into a hole in the desert would be an incredibly stupid, wasteful and irresponsible overreaction that would only cause more outrage and even greater loos of profit than they're already dealing with. These phones aren't landmines that are at serious risk of instantly killing anyone who handles them; They are moderately flammable trinkets that suffer catastrophic failure in certain common use scenarios. Chill the fuck out.\n\nThe combination of your ignorance about the problem and stupidity when it comes to suggesting solutions is... Astounding.",

The only downside of the Surface is lack of tablet/touch optimized apps, but browser is there, Office is there (even some semi touch variant), video player apps are there, and you can always stick it in a dock with external screen and use it as a real computer (which it is).\n\nThe rule of the i7 is that if you're asking whether you need an i7, you probably don't. i5 is a very capable processor, not at all underpowered, and it will play all current games (but the built-in GPU won't, but neither will the one in i7). i5 should heat a bit less.  \nI'd get the 8GB RAM one, because once you get it you can't upgrade it like you would a desktop PC, and the storage is really what you want (or how much you can afford). Bear in mind that Surface Pro has a full sized USB port that you can use for external storage (be it little flash drives with movies for a trip or a full on 2TB external HDD). Since SP3 is a normal laptop without a keyboard and a touch screen, I'd imagine SD cards work the same way as they do on any Windows laptop, you plug it in, you use it, you 'safely remove' it (or eject), and you take it out. It's removable storage, you can probably install software on it, but I don't think you can install Store apps on SD card (not that your SSD inside would be too small for all the useful Store apps anyway).  \nAnd I'm pretty sure they can take maximum available capacity that's on the market, and if not, there will probably be an update to support higher capacities (again, it runs normal Windows, if a Windows desktop/laptop PC can do it, so can Surface Pro).",

It's not really any more portable than laptop and it isn't nearly as useful as one. The maximum 64gb of storage isn't really enough to use it as some sort of media center, and it's too big to be a portable music player. Personally, I have no use for this device. I have a desktop computer for all of my school and gaming needs, and an iPhone for my portable Internet needs. I'd rather have a laptop than an iPad, and I hate using laptops. \n\nBut, if you're one of the many people excited about the iPad then good for you.

Professor gets up to start class and always presents via Power Point from his laptop. So the professor can't get his laptop to boot or whatever and is honestly about to cancel class when this Melvin steps up and says \"I have the slides downloaded, you can present from my laptop!\"\n\nObviously the whole class groans but whatever. Kid brings his machine forward with the presentation already open, connects to the projector and hands it over to the prof. Rest of class goes fine and the prof finishes up and closes Power Point. \n\nAt this point we are now looking at this poor guys desktop 20 feet tall on the screen in front of everybody.

Desktop is this weird hentai mixed with furry picture of two cat women having sex and of course one of them has a part that women aren't suppose to have. \n\nThe audible gasps, \"oh s%&$\", and cries of WTF?! go out from the whole class. Prof just looks at it, goes \"huhh\" and closes the lid. Should probably mention this prof is like 70 too. Poor kid had to make the walk of shame up to the front to claim his laptop.

Was waiting for the 15” air m4 and was also not happy with the price compared to some of the specs. Still wanted to pull the trigger but saw your comment and looked for alternatives: base m4 pro was available for 1649 here in Germany. The m4 air 15” with just the upgrade for storage would be 1749 here - that’s nuts. After reconsidering I now ordered the MacBook Pro M4 Pro for 1999. Thank you so much for supporting my decision and the honesty, while so many others fall into the hype train.",

The gap to the pro is small in terms of price (especially the moment you want the same storage) but very noticeable in specs (Screen, Storage, ports, Card Reader). Don’t get me wrong, I love the air and think the m1 air is probably my most favorite value notebook ever that I missed out on. I just hope at least the screen will get a little bit of love someday.",

My iPad Pro from 2018 has 120 Hz refresh rate. I can’t believe the MacBook Air M4 only has 60 Hz in 2025. Yes, I agree with Josh. I can’t deal with the low travel keyboard of the macbook air. The X9 places itself between a MacBook Air and a MacBook Pro. I never thought I was gonna look towards windows laptops, but they have come along way with beautiful oled touch screens, 120 Hz refresh rate almost standard, wifi 7 and new efficient chips, more than enough for every day tasks.",

Battery life is great, regularly get 6-8 hours of video watch time, and close to 11hrs of working on documents/web browsing. The build quality is fantastic, it&#39;s light as a macbook air and it&#39;s just a great all around laptop for someone that wants something that just works. I got mine for $1050USD and have been using it for just over 2 months now. The 2.8K 120HZ Screen is great for consuming content as well. Super pleased with my purchase. Unfortunately the battery health has degraded to 90% already and looks like I&#39;ll be needing to extend my battery replacement warranty.",

You do pay &quot;business money&quot; for it, but you can get it without being a pro. I&#39;m very happy with it since I got it on launch day, it&#39;s damn expensive but it&#39;s the best laptop I&#39;ve ever had, coming from a Surface Pro 7 and having had a few laptops from my job. Everything is awesome but the price. I decided to go &quot;no compromise&quot; and regret nothing so far, except that I can&#39;t seem to use the NPU for local LLMs at this point, so the &quot;AI stuff&quot; is useless at the moment (I don&#39;t use Copilot for ecological reasons, I can&#39;t fathom using tons of energy every time I have a request).",

The problem is the price range which skyrocketed when the 50th series launched. 5060 laptops with very good cpu&#39;s or ram or storage and a little bit of RGB are almost (or even) DOUBLE the prices of 4060 laptops, which is crazy.",

Then, after Sims 4 came out, an Asus laptop was recommended, but I doubted a laptop could do the job. After much research, I purchased it and loved it. Now, after an incredible 8 years, it has ended, and I need a new one immediately. The MSI and Asus&#39; highest-end seem great, the weight not so much. OLED screens seem like the best, too. You do a fantastic job catching me up on the new specs, but my head is spinning a bit as I struggle with weighing options, which I fear will lead to getting something I dont like. I need help on these issues: The convenience of a laptop, which I need, but the heavy weight could be a problem, or if I should get a lower mid-range laptop for things that require heavy use, but not for heavy gaming plus an excellent gaming PC computer. The price, though, would be crazy. I am unsure if you will respond to this as it is over a week old, or if somebody else can help me, but it would be much appreciated. ❤",

      "text": "This video is great but missing one thing. The first step should be:<br>Do you REALLY need a gamimg laptop?<br>You say you NEED it. But do you? Do you really? You&#39;re giving up a lot for the &#39;portability&#39;:<br>-Like Jason pointed out. Gaming or other GPU heavy use. Requires you to be plugged into a wall socket -Most people leave the laptop in one place. You say you will take it with you. Trust me. Unless your usecase forces you to, you won&#39;t! There also bigger, thicker and heavier then regular laptops. Adapter is bigger too. You might be better off with a desktop and a light laptop for on the go. For gaming a more portable steamdeck, Switch, etc. Those are also good for at home on the couch, bed, garden or balcony<br>-Nvidia used to add an M to their laptop GPU names. Wich was already misleading instead of a different name. Now they use the same name from desktop GPU&#39; for laptop GPU&#39;s. Even do there not (even close) the same products/preformance! TDP, RAM, ROPS, clockspeeds and more (can be) extremely cutdown<br>-Paying a very high premium for the same level desktop preformance. Even more difference when you can build your own desktop<br>-If you want the desktop experience at home. Costs are added for mouse, keyboard, monitor and dockingstation(to avoid plugging in and out cables every time)<br>-RAM latency is rarely in the specs and usually not the best. Sometimes not even the speeds are mentioned. In some laptops there is a single RAM stick. So NO duelchannel RAM! Check or ask this first if not clearly mentioned in specs<br>-Check out proffesionel test reviews and user opinions. Specific models have specific downsides<br>-When something breaks the whole thing has to go back. With desktops, you can (most of the time temporarily) replace a part. While you wait for RMA process",

Because lots of people sell their gaming laptop. After finding out they don&#39;t use the portability. So if your willing to wait for a good deal and collect it in person. You can find a good deal. Any RAM limitation you can easily upgrade yourself and sell what comes out",

But for 3k, I&#39;d rather just build a mini ATX and just carry it with me 🤷🏼‍♂️",

I can currently get the equivalent of an MSI raider as shown in the video except a very fast 2tb SSD 14k/R 13k/W which i expect is better than the 2tb version in the MSI, all the other specs are the same except the display which i can get a 300hz instead of the 120hz in the MSI all for £600 cheaper than the MSI.  I expect prices have dropped a little since this video but not that much, i think pre builds charge you extra for the name.",

I have a 7800x3d and a Radeon rx 7900 xtx with ddr5 ram and I’m currently trying to figure out what monitor to get all the different brands and such. I’m thinking a 1440p monitor for sure and I’m between 240-360hz I’m currently using a 120hz montior and I’m bottlenecked so either way is a huge jump. I hear OLED is definitely something I should get. What would you recommend for me?? I play only 2 games cs2 and Minecraft.",

I’ve been waiting patiently for it in the mail it finally came today and I’m not even opening it ! Shame on hp for doing this and not letting it be known I had to do some digging ! Anyway think I’m going to go with that acer with the 5070 to for 1899 or a rog strix so no buy the hp omen models with these screens plus they have many other issues !!!",

So you need to have the cord plugged in all the time, so in short, it’s like having a computer. Computer builds are cheaper too so these laptops are way over priced.",

Of course the retailer also matters as most physical retailers are pricier than online ones. And we can&#39;t beat those Costco and Walmart clearance sales. Seriously, $600 for a 4060 legion is a steal I wish was possible in other countries😭",

It was the best option to pickup locally, i&#39;ve upgraded it to 32GB RAM, and I think it&#39;s enough for the next 4 years. Love this laptop, best device I ever had. New devices for this price in my area have 3050/4050. I&#39;ve compared a lot of spec&#39;s of different GPUs and 150W version of my GPU beat some low TDP 4070, 3080Ti, in laptop media this GPU sitting at 35# in Mobile category. And for this price it&#39;s kinda cool, cuz 4070 even low TDP cost a way more, even used compared to 3070 Ti.",

If you do get one get a monitor but in my opinion so you guys dont get dissapointed get the 16gb ram 144hz rtx 4050 and an i5 for $680 USD ($1200 AUD). This laptop gets around 240 fps on max graphics with the specs I just mentioned and the build quality is fantastic, alot of people say the Hp victus 15 build quality sucks but Ive had mine for 2 and a half years and still works as if it is new! I hope this helped😅.   (THERE IS A SALE AND THIS LAPTOP IS SELLING FOR $200 USD WITH 16GB RAM, AN RTX 3050 AND A I5 GET IT QUICK!!!!!!!!)",

And if you&#39;re a hardcore gamer, you don&#39;t need the advice:  you already know that you have to buy top tier to be a hardcore gamer. <br><br>I ran a Maxed-out Lenovo Y-70 Touch from its launch date for 8 years with zero issues, running all day every day except MAYBE 72 hours per year at most, not a joke, not an exaggeration, as the full entertainment center hooked to the tv for streaming and movies/shows/browsing and to a monitor for work; and then upgraded to a Maxed-out Lenovo Legion with R9, the 16GB 3080, and 32GB of ram, and it has been running for 2 years straight except for maybe 24 hours total, at most, counting power outages. You get what you pay for, and you cannot scrimp when it comes to laptops.",

Now I&#39;m using a laptop with USB-C for work and it made my life easier. If you forgot yours, someone will always have one available. The normal charger might still be large, but you can keep it home and get a separate 65W one, which may be a lot smaller and better to travel with. It is definitely more than a &quot;nice to have&quot;.",

That means that when you use it while connected to a USB charger, the battery continuously charges and discharges, which isn&#39;t very healthy for it and shouldn&#39;t be your everyday solution",

      "text": "On the i/o front, I know this is more Canada/U.S. focused, but in Europe, a SmartCard reader does not go amiss if you don&#39;t do mobile ID. For keyboard, do not forget to check the layout. Again, in Europe some companies (like ASUS) do still sell ANSI layout keyboards, which means you will be missing a key if you are used to the ISO layout. NumPad may be important to you, maybe requiring you to use Fn combinations or even a NumPad hidden in the trackpad. But the most important thing about buying a laptop, see it in person. It is like dress shopping, pictures and reviews can only do so much, you can only know if you love it once you try it. A lot of electronics stores have display units or if the model you are specifically interested in isn&#39;t on display, you can usually ask the store clerk if you can try it out, check how the screen looks (if you can see the black lines between the pixels, if the colours &#39;feel&#39; off), how the keyboard feels etc. In that case, they generally allow it to boot to BIOS, but not to Windows or Linux. But you still get some idea of how it would feel like to actually use the laptop.<br>Also the display aspect ratios going from 16:9 to a more vertical style have a lot to do with the display technology maturing, giving us thinner bezels. So a new <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vddu2jmfVbI&amp;t=970\">16:10</a> 16&quot; laptop can physically be smaller than a 16:9 15.6&quot; laptop from a few yeaars ago. This is also noteworthy when checking for laptop bags or if wondering whether your new laptop would fit in the old one&#39;s bag.",

          "text": "@@Morphior Yeah, not sure why I mentioned a 14 at all...  I mean the 13 is a thin and light that hasn&#39;t tried to cook its battery.  The 16 is kinda thin, for a 16, but not at all light.  The major issue with the 16 is the longer length in the frame makes it slightly less rigid than the 13.  It kinda goes with the territory, but might be an issue depending on how rough you are with your machines.  <br><br>Regardless, I made a similar calculation.  Half the cost is the mainboard, the rest is screen, battery, case, and so on.  Even if Framework folds next week, I am reasonably happy with the build quality of what I have now, and if in 3 years I can get a couple generations newer hardware for <i>only</i> the board cost, I&#39;ll be breaking even on total system cost, with the better build quality.",

They&#39;re Dell Latitude, currently 5401, which is 9th gen i5, 16gb, and a whole ton of features like thunderbolt, smartcard (??), fingerprint, etc. The used market is great. Those Latitudes are VERY repairable compared to others, and RAM is extensible. The battery is also easy to remove.",

I used a T480 (max spec) for several years and my m2 pro macbook pro (base spec) blows it out of the water in almost every metric, especially build quality. The only things the Thinkpad wins at is modularity and maybe robustness, but I take good care of my stuff and would trust myself to replace the battery on my Macbook if it ever goes flat. Though my Thinkpad would probably be less frustrating with a fresh windows install and a new battery, it&#39;s still a great machine even it its current state.",

As most of these laptops are always under some kind of extended warranty, they want to limit warranty claims as there could be a lot of them. <br><br>However I have a deployed fleet of the Acer TravelMates and their screens break at the slightest touch or drop, so just go with someone else",

A laptop? anything with a video feed that could be recorded in secret. \n\nDo the same with audio.\n\nCollect lots and lots of evidence. Make back ups. Get a Dopbox account and store it on there.\n\nOnce you've collected the evidence, you'll need to decide for yourself what's best to do with it. This could involve presenting it to your parents, your councilor, the police, etc. but understand this immediately provides irrefutable evidence that could land one or both parents in jail.\n\nYou could also present it to one or both of your parent's employers. This places their job in immediate risk, and therefore your family's livelihood in immediate risk. You could use this as blackmail, etc. but I see that hurting you more than helping you most likely.\n\nYou will experience repercussions for forcing the issue on your parents. They may abuse you physically and I guarantee they will abuse you emotionally. This is not okay. That is not what parents do. As others have re-iterated in this thread, they are little more than shelter and food to you. Do you have a close friend whose parents would be willing to take you in for awhile? I don't suggest leaving your sister behind. This leaves her a prime target for abuse.\n\nIt appears you wish to handle this immediately. I say this because you reference being unable to talk your councilor until one-two days from now. I do not recommend rushing this. You should read all of the advice here and give days, even weeks of thought about how is best to proceed. This will also give you time to collect the necessary evidence.\n\npm me if you have any questions. about anything.",

Big gifts may not be for him. He needs to learn the consequences of. All or nothing kind of reactions do not sink well with kids and adults alike. If you bought him a new game system or toy he really wanted, return it. Clothing or educational items that he could use anyway should not be restricted. He must learn the difference between wants and needs. If he listens to his parents, does well in school, follows the rules (but do your best to see he understands that following rules doesn't mean he has to agree with them),  and shows that he is willing to improve...That he will earn his WANTS. NEEDS, such as seeing family and participating in events , should not be restricted. He may see such removal as too much and begrudge you for it for many years to come.Especially when he returns to the school and privileges he had before and is faced with the reality that his friends got what they wanted. This can prove even more true if he sees that the other children in the fight did not receive punishments as harsh as that which he dealt with. \n\nYour family members (especially grandparents) should be given advance notice of his parole . Circumventing your parentage will only work against the core family unit in the long run. Do not remove him, but simply restrict. No extra cake. No late night gaming or tv. If he wants to do something, have him do some light reading or other exploratory outlet.  If he is truly able to act and understand older than his age would suggest, it will sink in over time. Do not overly harp on him about the events. Let him know the difference between \"Past\" and \"Present\" and the effect on the \"future\" they have. \n\nYou were a kid once. Remember that.",

Obviously, you want to be a better one in the future and you are wise to be trying to come up with a plan to be that.\n\nBut right now, what kind of student are you and would you be best served going to a CC instead of a UC or CSU? With what very little you've said and from what I know from my own life and what I have seen (I work at a community college), you are more likely to find future success at a CC than a UC and probably a CSU.\n\nMake sure you don't confuse the student you actually are with the student you imagine yourself to be or hope to be in the future. A lot of folks make that mistake and it just costs them later since college is nowhere near as forgiving or understanding as high school.\n\nAnd keep this in mind: by far, high school GPA is the strongest indicator of success in college of all such data.

When you compare the specs to the cost, even at full retail price, it's just a **solid value laptop**. In fact, when my father-in-law asked what to get for my mother-in-law, this was where I pointed him, as it's the best value 2-in-1 on the market that fits her use case. \n\nJust words of advice to anyone considering that particular model:\n\n1. Make sure you get the model that has 12 GB of ram. It's got a 4 GB stick soldered to the MB, and one slot with an 8 GB stick. The 12 GB ram is effectively like 10 GB because 2 GBs are being used with the AMD integrated graphics. Or at least, that's how I understand it. Most other laptops at this price have 8GB of ram or less. \n\n2. Make sure the model of the flex 14 you buy has the 3500u processor. The 3500u is the chief reason why this laptop is such good value. Great performance compared to virtually all other laptop CPUs in its price range.",

I was wondering what your thoughts are and if there's any large difference between the two or if there's something similar?

Obviously it’s not the best value/performance ratio, and I could’ve gotten a much more powerful laptop for the same price, but I’ve had “gaming” laptops for most of my life (MSI GT70, 15” Alienware, MSI GS73VR), and I was certain I needed something a lot better made and better looking.\n\nIf you know what you’re getting, the Blade is a magnificent purchase. I’m a student (computer science), content creator, and part-time business professional, and I use my laptop heavily for all of those. I needed something portable, sleek & professional, very powerful, and with a great battery life — for me, that comes down to a low-end Razer Blade or a high-end Dell XPS. I was expecting a beefier GTX 1660 Ti in the high-end XPS 15 2019, but they only gave it a GTX 1650 — which isn’t strong enough for me — so I was forced to bite the bullet on the higher-priced Blade. I wish the 2019 Advanced Blade came with a cheaper RTX 2060 model, because the 2070 is overkill for me personally and I’d prefer a longer battery life.",

Here's everything you need to know to choose the right gaming-notebook monster, along with our top lab-tested picks.\n\nPurists will argue that you need a PC to truly play games, especially if you're a fan of pushing the levels of graphics quality beyond the capabilities of a mere gaming console. In this regard, the gaming desktop is still king, particularly when it comes to having the kind of components and horsepower needed to run 4K games smoothly and support virtual reality (VR) setups, such as the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive. But if you want or need something you can tote around the house or over to your friend's place, we're here to help you choose the right gaming laptop.\n\n**How Much Should You Spend on a Gaming Laptop reddit?**\n\nGaming systems have higher-end components than run-of-the-mill consumer laptops, so their prices consequently will be higher, but the range across the category is huge: from under a grand to $5,000 and up. The budget gaming laptops start at around $700 and can go up to about $1,250. For that, you get a system that can play games at full HD resolution (1080p) with the settings turned down in most titles, or at maximum quality settings in simpler games. Storage may be a hard drive, or a modest-capacity solid-state drive (SSD). An SSD is always preferable.\n\nWant something better? Midrange systems give you smoother gameplay at high or maximum settings on a better-quality 1080p screen (possibly in concert with a special high-refresh screen; more on that in a moment), and should add support for VR headsets. These models will range in price from around $1,250 to $2,000\n\nRazer Blade \n\nHigh-end systems, meanwhile, should guarantee you smooth gameplay at 1080p with graphics details maxed out, often with a high-refresh screen. They even might let you play at 4K resolution, if the screen supports it. A high-end model should also be able to power a VR headset and support additional external monitors. These machines tend to come with speedy storage components such as PCI Express solid-state drives, and they are priced above $2,000, often closer to $3,000.",

For right around $1,000, you have your choice of fierce, fast-running gaming laptops. Check out the best low-cost, GeForce- and Radeon-equipped gaming notebooks we've tested in our labs. We've got all the buying advice you need to land a bargain.\n\nI have owned, customized, and built a lot of computers over the past 30 years, and one trend is clear: laptops have become much more desirable for consumers today than desktop PCs. Today's computers all handle work and casual consumption very well and come in all sorts of forms and functions. Where power is still needed are hardcore gaming and professional work, such as photography, videography, and architectural drawings.\n\nSUMMARY: this Dell G7 G7790-7662GRY-PUS is an above-average gaming laptop with the speedy power to perform heavy work, packaged in a muted, sleek, metal finish. It presents excellent gaming performance for its price range, is a nice upgrade over last year's debut model, but still suffers from disappointing battery life.\n\nPROS- Above-average gaming performance for the price range- GeForce GTX 1660Ti 6GB DDR6 graphics processor can play most currently-released games at High 1080p settings near 60 FPS or higher- Great price for a budget gaming laptop- Bright screen (17.3\" IPS 1080p 60Hz)- Display lid is easy to open with one hand- Decent VR performance, though it scored perfectly on the StreamVR test- Metal finish with less plastic used than the previous generation- Keyboard has RGB backlighting, allowing you to change the colors (and effects) for 4 different zones using the Alienware Command Center app- Keyboard feels great for everyday typing- Great work laptop for those who do a lot of photo or video editing (CPU: 9th Gen Intel Core i7-9750H)- Hard drive storage (M.2): Toshiba 512GB NVMe SSD (KXG60ZNV512G). This is a quality hard drive- Hard drive storage (2.5\" SATA): this slot was open, and so I added a 1TB drive- Memory: 16GB DDR4 2666MHz RAM was included (two 8GB modules), offering more than enough processing capacity for even the demanding gamer- Sound was powerful, but not full. In Call of Duty, some bullet sounds were a bit hollow and tinny. However, with some tweaking using the Alienware Command Center app, the sound was much improved- Sound is front firing below the front edge of the laptop- Lots of available ports: 1x USB Type-C (with Thunderbolt 3), 3x USB-A 3.1, DisplayPort, HDMI 2.0, Gigabit Ethernet, 3.5mm audio jack, Memory card reader (SD, SDHC, SDXC)- Cooling system: dual-channel heat sink/fan system. Air is taken in through the bottom rear and sides, exiting through the back- Good web cam- Windows 10 Home 64-bit included\n\nCONS- Noisy during high-performance use, though relatively quiet during less intense times- Heavy at 7.2 lbs- Bulky at 15.9\" x 11.7\" x 1\", though it is slightly slimmer than heavy-duty gaming laptops. However, hauling this beast around every day is less than ideal- Below average battery life (60Wh 4-cell), making it not very suitable for travel. During normal web browsing and basic tasks, it only lasted about 2.5-4 hours. For a movie played on a loop, between 4-6 hours. For gaming: don't even try- Bottom of the laptop got quite hot during high-performance gaming, mostly due to the Intel i7-9750H processor drawing a lot of power and producing high heat (100F+). As a result, thermal throttling could reduce the overall performance- Trackpad could use improvement, but most gamers likely would use a mouse anyway- Keyboard felt tight in some areas, such as the directional and Function keys\n\nTIPS/NOTES- Laptop's build quality is fair, but the top panel flexes and depresses easily as opposed to the more rigid and dense-feeling Alienware line- The hinge performs well and appears to last for some time- The GeForce video card cannot be swapped out. It is integrated into the motherboard- Although it appears there would be room to accommodate a 3rd hard drive, Dell chose not to utilize that space\n\nGAME TESTS- Ghost Recon: Wildlands, Grand Theft Auto V, and Shadow of the Tomb Raider worked well at the high/highest setting- The Division 2 struggled during the more intense scenes at the high/highest setting\n\nOverall, the laptop is an above-average gaming one on a budget with a relatively slim, muted look. It is sleek, fairly well-built, and does not scream for attention like Dell's premium Alienware brand. Dell made a huge compromise by including an ill-lasting battery, although most gamers are unlikely to buy laptops to be played on the go for an extended period of time. For business or casual use, this laptop is more than adequate and is capable of running VR, crunching video productions, and processing photo edits. Certainly, it is a much improved version over its first-generation predecessor.",

From the customizeable individual keys on the keyboard, to the many custom fan control settings, sound profile settings and overclock settings, there is something for everyone with this machine. The build quality is pretty top notch, although comming from a new Macbook Pro, you will not find it to be on par with Apple hardware. It is made of a nice soft touch like material on the body with shiny ( i like this) plastic around the screen with gorgeous honeycomb air intake grilles on the top and a color changing customizeable power butotn in the shape of an alien head.  \nThe keyboard is FANTASTIC with excellent travel and feeling. I have never felt a laptop keyboard as good with such excellent clicking action as this one. If you type a lot this is the keyboard for you. My 2016 touchbar Macbook Pro had the worlds worst keyboard so this is a godsend. The touch pad is made of premium glass with a fantastic finish and it scrolls smooth as butter however, it is small for the size of the laptop and it does leave me wanting more touch pad real estate but I can ignore this due to the benefits of this laptop. I love the fact that I can literally customize individual keys on this keyboard with colors. I play games where I turn off the entire keyboard back light and only turn on and customize the color of the individual keys that I use for the game so they are better visible. For example, I disable the entire keyboard back light and programmed it to disable when the specific game loads and then the WASD key configuration lights up only in bright red or bright blue and the rest stays dark so I can focus on the keys. This is SOOO helpful and can be tailored to any type of game or program you're using. I have never suffered from overheating and throttling issues as others have stated and I always keep it on the balanced program. The laptop fans, when they kick in high, can get loud so be prepared but that is a price to pay for having such a thin gaming laptop with this much power. The RTX 2060 6gb is NOT Max-Q so it is not underclocked and undervolted and only trails behind the 2070 Max-Q by like 5% so save the money and buy the 2060 model. I love Alienware's command software center. It has everything that I need to customize the laptop. It is slightly confusing to me but I've gotten the hang of it just fine by now. The screen brightness is perfectly fine for me and the refresh rate of 144 mhz rate is fantastic. I wouldn't use this monitor and expect 100% color accuracy and sharpness for photo editing or professional video editing like I would on the Macbook Pro, but it does the job and it's plenty bright for my needs. The port selection on this laptop is fantastic and I love the placement of the ports on the rear to keep everything clutter free. Keyboard bending is almost non existent when pressed in, it feels solid. Yes it is a bit more expensive then other laptops with similar specs but the design and customizable features make it worth the extra 200 bucks imho.",

The best gaming laptop with an RTX 2070 for under $1500 is the MSI GP65.\n\nAnother up-to-date component in the GP65 is the processor, the 9th Gen Intel Core i7-10750H. It does have some minor improvements compared to the previous generation i7-9750H CPU. This means it will handle any demanding applications with ease.\n\nPros\tCons\n\nCan run almost all games on 60 fps on ultra settings\tQuite loud fans\n\n144Hz IPS display\tExterior prone to fingerprints\n\nExcellent 9th gen Intel Core i7 processor\tNo Thunderbolt 3 port\n\n**#2 The Newcomer: ASUS ROG Strix G15**\n\nAnother good RTX 2070 gaming laptop under $1500 is the Asus Rog Strix G15.\n\nThe main thing that makes it’s design stand out is the RBG led strip around the edge of the bottom of the case. Even if the chassis is mostly made of plastic, it’s surprisingly robust. It has all the latest ports, including USB 3.2, a display port, and an HDMI 2.0b port that can handle an external 4K monitor.

      "text": "Acer Predator Helios 300 Gaming Laptop, Intel i7-10750H, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 6GB, 15.6\" Full HD 144Hz 3ms IPS Display, 16GB Dual-Channel DDR4, 512GB NVMe SSD, Wi-Fi 6, RGB Keyboard, PH315-53-72XD: This is a very good laptop that is very capable of AAA gaming at high settings. It was packaged well with seals to prevent any kind of tampering during shipping. Included was a very basic, but free neoprene sleeve for the laptop. There are no straps or pouches but it is soft and will protect the laptop during travel better than if it were left exposed, but I would still suggest getting a carrying case or a backpack if you do plan on being portable with this. Also included was an HDD upgrade cable and screws in case you want to add a your own 2.5'' drive to the empty bay on the motherboard.  \n\n\nThe 1080p 3ms 144hz IPS display looks great and also has great viewing angles. If you've never used a 144hz Panel before, you can never go back to 60Ghz monitors for gaming again. 144Hz ruined my last gaming laptop because the difference is extremely noticeable (in general, it feels smoother when you move in games) compared to 60Hz panels. The webcam is passable at 720p. It's fine for chatting with friends or zoom meetings but not recommended for anything beyond that. It also cannot work with Windows Hello. The 10th gen Intel i7-10750H 6core 2.6Ghz base clock speed processor is very efficient, powerful, and has decent integrated graphics (which the laptop will prefer to use when you aren't playing games or doing any kind of intensive work that would require more GPU power). There's a lot of value in this laptop given that this CPU alone is sold for $400 and the laptop also has an RTX 2060 6GB. The RTX is the newest architecture that has the ability to do ray-tracing. If you don't know what that is, it's realistic lighting effects that developers are putting into games now, but you need a card that has the ability to process it or you can't take advantage of the feature.  \n\n\nThe RTX 2060 GPU is very capable. My average FPS with very high settings on Assassin's Creed Odyssey was 70. In GTA V on high settings, it was 115. Interestingly, this laptop has a button called Turbo. Now, there's no overt explanation for what it does when you take the laptop out of the box and don't read the manual, but it essentially overclocks the GPU for you and kicks the fans into hyper-drive to compensate for the extra heat involved with overclocking it. In terms of performance, on the two games I tested the FPS on, it gave me an average of a 10FPS increase. It is noisy though when the fans are on full blast. I have to give credit to the fans which Acer advertises as \"4th Gen AeroBlade™ 3D technology\" and the thermal management of this design because even when the CPU and GPU are being stressed, the laptop stays at a reasonable temperature, and by that I mean you can game with it on your laptop while sitting down without it becoming too uncomfortable. Aside from the Turbo button, there's also a Predator button on the keyboard. Pressing this opens an application that shows you the current temperatures of CPU/GPU and even ambient temperature inside the laptop itself overall. You can customize your lighting profile here, overclock your GPU with 3 speeds (normal, fast, extreme), and you can set your fan speeds to a custom setting or leave it on automatic. Because Acer has this application that controls these settings from OS, the UEFI BIOS is pretty sparse. You can't customize voltages or do any kind of manual overclocking, but since the application does all that for you, and many gamers don't overclock their system because they think it might be too complicated or risky, this makes it easy to do so with a simple click of the turbo button or drop down menus in the application. Speaking of the BIOS, you're going to want to go into it (spam F2 when the laptop is powering on), and disable the annoying POST sound. By default, when you turn the laptop on, it plays a sound file that sounds like a jet engine firing up for some reason. I turned it off because I found it incredibly annoying, but I'm thankful the option to do that existed in the BIOS. Other than that, there isn't a whole lot of customization to do in the BIOS. It also has WiFi 6! It comes with 16GB of RAM (two @ 8GB) but the DIMMS are user serviceable so you can put 32GB (two 16GB) if you wanted to with no issues.  \n\n\nThe OS comes per-configured somewhat, using performance metrics for the OS (such as not using the Aero theme). There is some bloatware which I recommend removing.  \nIn terms of build quality...this is where the laptop starts to show its low price point. The entire laptop is made out of plastic, and it flexes really easily, especially the panel. The plastic trackpad is just OK, it will function for web browsing and light tasks but it's not that responsive overall. The two small cutouts for the sound underneath the laptop is a really bad design flaw I wish more laptop manufacturers would get away from. Please just include top facing speakers. The speakers themselves are already not great, so when they're shooting downwards it makes it even harder to hear some games even when the volume in game is at 100 and the operating system volume is also at 100. For this reason, you'll want headphones to go along with the laptop.  \nThe ports available are:  \n\n\nLeft side--Kensington lock, RJ45 ethernet, two USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 ports, 3.5mm audio jack  \nRight side--Mini-displayport, HDMI, USB-A 3.2 Gen 2 port (gen 2 adds charging capabilities even when the laptop is powered off), and USB-C using 3.2 Gen 2.  \nBehind--Charging port. Kudos to Acer for putting the charging port in the center behind the laptop.  \n\n\nAcer rates the battery as being up to 6 hours, but don't expect to do heavy gaming on this laptop while you aren't plugged in. I got about 2 with some minor downtime between games.  \n\n\nOne thing I want to talk about is the design of the laptop. It does look good, but I think Acer needs to think about the type of person buying this laptop. It's going to be mostly students who want a gaming laptop that they can also use to bring to class. I don't think that gaming laptops necessarily need to look like \"gaming laptops\". A more subtle design and the removal of any kind of LEDs on the exterior of the laptop would appeal to a much wider audience in my opinion.  \n\n\nOverall, this laptop is an incredible deal. For what you pay, you're getting an incredible capable gaming laptop",

      "text": "\\[2020\\] Gigabyte AERO 15 WB Thin+Light Performance Laptop, 15.6\" 144Hz FHD IPS Display, GeForce RTX 2070 Max-Q, Intel Core i7-10750H, 16GB DDR4, 512GB NVMe SSD, Up to 8.5-hrs Battery Life: I’m writing this review 2 weeks into using the GIGABYTE Aero 15X v8-BK4 15\" Ultra Slim Gaming Laptop 144Hz FHD Thin Bezel X-Rite i7-8750H, GeForce GTX 1070, 16G RAM, 512GB SSD, Metal Chassis, RGB Keyboard, Longer Battery Life”  \n\\*\\*Note\\*\\* Before I begin, I wanted to say the ‘cons’ part of the review goes out of the window if you have a little knowledge about computers and know how to clean install Windows and its drivers.  \nCons:  \n\\- The screen bleed and bounce:  \n\n\nNow, because they have tried to reduce the weight of the laptop, they have compromised on the screen weight causing it to bounce a little bit (This is my logic but could be absolutely wrong). It is not the worst but I would expect better from a $2400 Laptop.  \n\n\nWhen you start the Laptop, you can see that screen bleed is present. This could be at random places for random machines. Mine is at both the bottom corners. It does not affect the screen when you use it but as someone with OCD it does bother me a bit that my screen bleeds.  \nRecommendation: Live with it  \n\\- The Bloatware:  \nI am a strong believer of harnessing the true powers of the hardware your computer possesses. This Laptop is a beast in that aspect. Naturally the bloatware slows it down.  \n\n\nRecommendation: I would highly recommend that the company come out with a version that doesn’t have bloatware. Charge $50-100 more if need be. If you’re a non-technical user, go to your local computer shop and get a clean windows install done. It makes this Laptop a beast.  \n\n\n\\- Mouse Hangs:  \nThey use the ELAN driver to run the mouse. When we start an intensive process, the mouse will hang for about less than a second and go back to normal. This is something I would not expect from a laptop of this specifications.  \nRecommendation: Clean install does the trick.  \n\n\n\\- Battery Drain upon downloading latest Nvidia drivers.  \nThis might not count as Gigabytes fault but my battery dropped from 8hrs to 2hrs on full charge when I downloaded the latest Nvidia driver.  \n\n\nRecommendation: The work around is to visit the Gigabyte website and download what they have up on there. It went back to normal.  \n\n\n\\- Caps doesn’t have a light:  \n\n\nThis is a minor issue but the Caps lock button does not have a light to indicate if its on or not. The screen does show it but a light would be better.  \nRecommendation: Live with it.  \n\n\n\\- Games do not load sometimes.  \nInitially (I faced this the first week) the laptop takes time to switch from power saver mode to performance/game mode. This causes performance drops and Games do not load. The GPU suffers with power saver mode and the switch is not immediate (I understand where Gigabytes comes from because their marketing is based on the battery)  \nRecommendation: Get past the first week of frustration, update your drivers and this goes away and the PC performs flawlessly.  \n\n\n\\- Sound is above average at best  \nNow I’m no DJ or I do not work with sound or use my laptop’s speakers but the sound is somewhat weird. Like its coming out of a $10-dollar Bluetooth speaker. They do have fancy Dolby Drivers in there but I’m not sure if the hardware lives up to it.  \n\n\n\\- Drivers not in place = BSOD  \nI’m not sure which GPU is causing it but sometimes on startup I face BSOD due to a Video Graphics error. It is due to one of the Graphic cards. I’ve updated both the 1070 and the intel but still facing it occasionally.  \nMy YouTube stopped working recently because of GPU Driver update. I did a clean install of the driver and it works fine now.  \nPros:  \n\\- Light for what it packs:  \n\n\nYou will immediately notice how sleek elegant and light the laptop is. I was truly impressed by how light it is despite having a metal chassis and the Hardware it has.  \n\n\n\\- 16gigs or RAM on a single channel:  \nThe RAM they provide is mounted on a single channel. I know splitting the slot gives more performance but single channel means you can upgrade to 32Gigs without having to buy two sticks.  \n\n\n\\- Battery Life:  \nThe battery life on this beast is phenomenal. Gives me 8 hours for office work and about 4 hours on intense gaming. Note: I would recommend plugging in when you game for better performance.  \n\n\n\\- The screen as clear as it gets:  \nThe screen is beautiful and I can see every pixel on Adam Levine’s face on YouTube.  \n\n\n\\- Thunderbolt port:  \nIt comes with a thunderbolt port and plenty of other USB ports. This means its future proof at least for the next 4-5 years.  \n\n\n\\- Fan Doesn’t sound like a helicopter or heat up as much:  \nIf you plan on buying a laptop with this configuration, unless you set up some sort of water cooling, it is going to warm up. I purchased one of the cooling pads available on amazon but this laptop does not heat up as much as some others do. Stays silent too. Would recommend getting a cooling pad to extend the life of the laptop though.  \n\n\n\\- Overall handles intensive tasks with ease.  \nAs an example: I run 3 Virtual machines talking to each other + Team Viewer simultaneously with ease and without lag. This set up gives me 4 hours of battery which is phenomenal. My GNS3, Pycharm, Photoshop also breezes through.  \n\\- Easy to upgrade:  \nOpening the laptop and upgrading it is easy. Anyone with YouTube can do it.  \n\n\n\\- The NIC on it is Blazing Fast:  \nThe WiFi Adapter on this PC is amazing. The download speeds for me have been 10mbps- 15mbps on an average.  \n\\- Two Year warranty:  \nMost companies give you a year worth of warranty but Gigabyte gives you two.  \n\n\nConclusion:  \nI spent a lot of time deciding between this the MSI variant (similar specs with 256 gb SSD) at 2k and the Razor (Ditto specs at 2.8K) and settled for this.  \nIf you’re a power user go for it. It’s worth the money. Zippy and Light. If you’re a moderate user: Go for something cheaper and If you’re rich: Just buy it anyway.  \nI would love to end this by repeating that doing a clean install of windows on this will make you fall in love with this laptop.",

First, regarding its speed – it's incredibly fast booting up and in shutting down even when Windows 10 wants to install updates during reboots. I have never had a machine handles updates more quickly. While downloading some Steam Valve games over WI-Fi, for instance, I noted speeds that were close to what I've gotten over a hard-wired Ethernet connection. The speed of games I play reached 65 mbps, nearly twice the 35 mbps I got with them on every other computer I've tried. I had it connected at 5Ghz to obtain these speeds, I didn\\`t bother with 2.4Ghz because I have too many other streaming devices latched onto that signal of my router already.  \nWhen it comes to installing software and/or loading programs and multi-tasking the Zeph M is very smooth and responsive, switching between applications seamlessly. The i7-9750h makes this possible with its Hexacore processing and speeds from 2.6-4.5Ghz. This capability is doubtlessly due to the 16 gigs of ddr4 ram and the Ge-force RTX 2070 graphics with Max-Q design. The card had 8 gigs of its own ram (DDR6), enabling me to set my games' resolution with a 240Hz 3ms refresh rate: sharp, detailed and the smoothest that I've ever seen my Resident Evil 5 run. This computer also has the strongest onboard graphics Intel 630 to switch to if you want to consume less power but still play games without much loss in quality.  \n\n\nThere is a 1TB SSD inside that syncs nicely with the above mentioned speed and seamlessness, with rapid boot times and shut downs. The audio is incredible with a surreal 3-D feel about it, though this effect is evident only in a very quiet room. A minor short-coming with this audio, however, is that the maximum volume on stock apps (and on Windows 10 master volume controls) is not very loud against constant background noise. If that requirement is met, it\\`s like a mini theater in your lap.  \n\n\nThere are a few cons that need mention: It comes with an average amount of bloat, and some of its more personalized software was a disappointment due to the fact that many were free trials, something that I didn't catch until after I'd installed them. This makes such programs seem more like additional bloatware to me. Also, this laptop does not come with a camera; the pre-installed Skype program is aggressive enough to remind you that you either need install a camera or uninstall Skype. There is no SD card slot. Many devices really on them these days and they are very fairly standard even in relatively inexpensive machines. Nor is there a CD/DVD reader/writer either, though this is less surprising given that such devices can been seen as dated tech by now. I suspect that this particular omission may also have been taken to keep this laptop as thin and sleek as it is. By way of compensation, there are three standard USB and one USB-C ports. Ethernet, headphone, HDMI, and a mic ports make up the rest of the inputs.  \nThe system does consume large amounts of energy so the battery comes off a little disappointing. Even while it was plugged in it would only max out at 96 percent charge, at which I was worried it was defective but after shutting it down and charging it would reach 100%. It can also become very hot and the internal fan is rather noisy. A few tweaks will alleviate some of these issues and the software that comes with it can help you customize different profiles for this.  \nNow the best part for me that grabbed my attention was the design. It's thin 15.6 inch perfection in a titanium brushed lid and a very nice illuminated red logo. The keys are large, flat and smooth, very quiet to the touch. The keyboard comes with an Aura feature, which illuminates the keys in a rainbow of color, pattern, pulses, etc. All the keys are well lit and easy to understand when it comes to media keys and icons for specialized keys. You can customize your very own light show on your keyboard. There is no number keypad, but who cares ? It's pretty enough to forgive that. These features sacrifice battery power so I'd suggest employing them only while the machine is connected to its power supply. I must say that this is a very impressive system and if you can afford it, I'd say go for it ... you will not be disappointed by its performance.",

      "text": "Razer Blade 15 Gaming Laptop 2019: Intel Core i7-9750H 6 Core, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060, 15.6\" FHD 1080p 144Hz, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, CNC Aluminum, Chroma RGB Lighting, Thunderbolt 3; After way too much research and weighing pros and cons, I finally decided to pull the trigger on the 15\" Blade Base model (with ethernet) with GTX 1660Ti. I needed something that would be overkill as a desktop replacement in the field. This is it.  \n\n\nPurpose: I work as a sound mixer in film production and occasionally we have musical elements that require a serious workstation. I needed a powerhouse for multi-tracking Pro Tools. I occasionally game on it, I'd say about 20% of the time, but primarily this is for sound/audio tasking in a professional environment.  \n\n\nPros:  \n\\- specs. I love a laptop that can crush most desktops.  \n\\- brilliant screen. Awesome colors, great contrast, and of course 144hz is mandatory for gaming. I can't use 60hz anymore, even for daily office duties, I can see the flicker now, and it fatigues me.  \n\\- build quality is superb. It looks fantastic, feels exceptionally well made, definitely puts MacPro aesthetic and \"quality\" to shame. Also, durability is expected to be top notch. When I'm shopping for new equipment, if it's on demo in a store, I'll go in and do drop tests; spike it into the counter, slam it around, bend the screen, mistreat it, pound the keyboard, hit the trackpad, etc. Out of everything, this felt the best. No creaking of the chassis when you pick it up at a corner, no flex when you push on the case, none of that BS.  \n\\- performance is incredible. I've never seen it hiccup or stall on anything, even when recording 5-6 tracks in ProTools with dozens of CPU-intensive plugins running. I loaded up some massive sessions (80+ tracks) with plugins on every slot, and it still wasn't even trying. Now I'll even do quick edits to sessions instead of firing up the desktop rig. I don't play Call of Dooty MW, but all the other modern and less modern games I threw at it were a cakewalk.  \n\\- ports. it has the perfect combination. I have the Base model (w/ ethernet), and along with the USB-C port, there's really no reason why you can't match any desktop rig in terms of connectivity. I plugged in my Satechi USB-C breakout, and everything worked simultaneously.  \n\\- aesthetic. I have to say it again, it looks phenomenal.  \n\n\nCons:  \n(these are VERY pessimistic, like if I was in a horrible mood and someone forced me to say negative things)  \n\\- despite the screen being incredible, there is \\*some\\* light bleed at the corners (3 of 4, to be exact). I understand this to be a big flaw for some people, but I don't play visually dark games. Even when watching a dark scene in a movie, I can't tell. It's only on bootup when the screen is 99.99% black. Occasionally when Photoshopping I'll notice it, but again, it's very very minor in the overall perspective of having other colors/things on the screen.  \n\\- keyboard takes getting used to. after 2 days it felt natural, but it's not the easiest learning curve. I have a mechanical keyboard on my desktop with Cherry Browns, so the contrast couldn't be more extreme, but I can flip flop between the two with no problem now. Also, per other peoples' comments, the arrows are definitely misplaced; they need to be moved one button/column over to the right, or swapped with the shift key.  \n\\- battery life is pretty bad. But, this IS a gaming machine/desktop replacement. With screen brightness cranked and playing an intensive game, I can barely make it over 2 hours. Day to day office use with screen brightness set moderately, I can pull maybe 4-5 hours. It does recharge quickly, however.  \n\\- fans. they're definitely there. this would be a legit negative trait. If you're in a bone quiet room doing emails and youtube, you'll barely hear them. But, if you're gaming, they get pretty loud. For the performance, this is a small caveat.  \n\\- lid logo, this is the only other real \"negative\" quality for me. In a professional setting, I can't have it glowing, as much as I personally do love it. I skinned it with the matte black cover from SopiGuard. Still looks awesome.  \n\n\nAgain, I just want to reiterate these cons are subtle at their worst. I wanted to give a thorough breakdown of the bad qualities, as mild as they are.  \n\n\nOverall: If you can afford it, do it. Get the 4-year warranty through Amazon (Asurion) so you have nothing to lose. I turn on the desktop rig significantly less now, when it's so easy to reach for the Blade and get work done. I'm not a brainless Razer fanatic by any means, but I have to admit, this is the best option out there right now, and I'm becoming a fan.",

It is a 12 inch tablet but with full desktop windows and laptop grade hardware. You definitely wont be gaming on the thing but light games such as league on low settings or minecraft or something would be ok. \n\nIt has a 2160x1440 resolution which on a 12 inch tablet will look phenomenal. It comes with a low-voltage i3, i5, or i7 (your choice) and either a 64, 128, 256, or 512gb SSD (depends on your CPU choice). It weighs under 2lbs so it gets a gold star for portability/performance ratio. You can buy a keyboard for it but it is extra. It's also pretty good considering its an attachable tablet keyboard.\n\nAlso I didn't mention it because I didn't have enough room but I linked everything but one laptop on Amazon. Please please please look elsewhere as well to see what deals you can get. Amazon for me has always been a low price but deals happen (Amazon was also easiest to navigate through the different varieties of laptops).",

We know it has a corrective effect on stamina expenditure during the race. We know it contributes in some way to maintaining your top speed for a short while even if you run out of stamina. But whenever players tried to test how impactful Guts is in isolation, they've always basically come up empty. The consensus is: having high Guts is better than having low Guts but certainly not at the expense of Speed, Power, Intelligence, and Stamina. It's also the stat with the highest energy expenditure during training and therefore the hardest stat to max out unless you load up your deck with Guts cards. And the Guts SSR cards we've had so far have all been fairly underwhelming. All in all, it's just never been worthwhile to care about Guts\n\nAnd about Bakushin-o, remember to change her strategy to Front. It still slightly depends on what support cards you have, what skills you're buying, what events you proc during the run, but assuming you're being pretty optimal and you get ~300 WIT for skill procs, yes, you can absolutely otherwise spam SPD on her and win URA without much trouble.",

Give an inch and theyll take a mile and last years AI agreements were the inch. If this was actually about AI protections SAG would've taken a firm stance against any and all AI last year, but they didn't. \n\nHow these VAs can fully trust that SAG truly has their best interests at heart after what the union did last year is beyond me. Many of them even spoke out against those agreements at the time but of course they all fell right back in line like good soldiers.",

      "text": "In the actors’ defense, you *really* need a lawyer if you want to understand exactly how all these different contracts and agreements and state/national/international laws and whatnot interact.\n\nThe union’s line is that they aren’t going to *truly* fuck anyone over because the transition to being paid union rates will quickly cover the cost of membership + there are still ways for foreign VAs to stay on projects. I don’t think they’re lying outright there. That’s why they’ve survived at all with a $3000 membership fee— the union card really does pay for itself. But they are avoiding questions like “what about cost of living/medical bills/other factors that might make someone need more than the 120-day maximum waiver time to come up with a spare $3k” or “what if someone lives in a country where there *isn’t* a standing agreement with their local union/isn’t currently a member of their local union for whatever reason” or “why does the union only care about this now after so many years of apathy” or “what happens if local laws and/or political factors forbid a company from signing *any* direct agreement with a US-based union”. It’s an incomplete answer because acknowledging how messy the reality is means acknowledging how long SAG-AFTRA spent being inconsistent about their treatment of VAs. \n\nThe corporate PR line, of course, is that this is just a power grab out of nowhere. This, too, is *somewhat* true— it’s obvious SAG wouldn’t have ripped the Band-aid off if there hadn’t been a crisis situation in the industry. However, what the actual holdouts in this situation (in other words, the directly struck companies who are refusing to negotiate and thus leaving other companies *needing* interim agreements to get voice work) don’t want to admit is that they’ve also proven why worker solidarity is so important in the first place. People whose governments won’t protect them from AI need to do it themselves, and that’s pretty much impossible to do without *a* union involved. Is SAG the best union to represent VAs? Probably not! They’ve always been infamously Hollywood-centric, and the US has never respected the profession the way counties like Japan do; that applies as much to fellow actors as anyone else. But they’re what’s available, and there’s no time to even *think* about organizing a separate VAs’ union with some studios already *actively planning* how to use AI instead of humans. The time to reform or split off from SAG is *not now*.",

Some well-appreciated Genshin VAs suggest (indirectly or not) that they would shun strikebreakers if not deny them such opportunities if they are themselves cast directors... which, to be honest, would just be how business works and, more importantly, not a big issue for the public since it's not supposed to know what happens behind the scenes.\n\nOn the other hand, I'm not sure the impact on public reputation may be always worth it. VAs' reputation is a publicity driver for better or worse: those defending moral causes can be well-perceived by the audience and limit collateral consequences on their career if they are hard to target... while on the other hand, those who do crass acts openly may have to deal with those stains constantly brought up by informed individuals (looking at sexual offenders apologists), with the risk of public and peer pressure ousting them out from projects.\n\nNot to mention that in the current context, it harms the perception of the strike's legitimacy... which is a strategic fuckup (especially turning supporters into skeptical at best, opposed at worst). As others mentioned, the lack of PR awareness and crisis management is baffling (can vouch by experience, if I was a manager I'd advise some talents to stay silent or neutral, can't really hurt their reputation by not taking risks).",

It’s frankly disappointing to the highest degree that my government actively works against the best interests of the majority of its citizens. Frankly I could go on and on and on and on about this because the politics in the US right now are threatening my livelihood (I have multiple preexisting diseases, mental health issues under treatment, and am on welfare), depending on how things go here the next 4 years there’s a real chance I just die. \n\nSo yeah I’m in agreement with most of what you have said, you’re right, it should be better, the government should be protecting its citizens. \n\nBut the facts are that it doesn’t and it won’t. We have an anti-vaxxer who mutilates dead whales to drive their carcass home and had worms eating his brain leading our national health department. Our director of national intelligence is a known Russian asset. Our president is a known Russian asset. Our department of defence leader is an alcoholic who worked in a propaganda fake news show. Our other departments are being cut and defunded by a South African ketamine fiend and his band of 20 year old racist gamers. \n\nWe don’t have the best or the right people on the job and people are so blind to what’s happening it’s completely absurd to think that anything positive will happen for workers, union or non-union, from our government. \n\nSo the only choice left for these Va’s to defend their rights and salaries and lives is to back the union. And on that, SAGAFTRA is also not a normal union. That’s part of why its fees are so high in comparison to other unions in the US as well. They are a guild. Guilds by design are intended and meant to be monopolies. The flip side is they have even more bargaining power as a result. If they start fucking over the actors that are a part of the guild those actors would not pay the fees and join and the guild would fall apart. That it is still around is a sign that it’s members view the benefits from joining it favorably. \n\nSo again, I agree with pretty much everything you’re saying, idealistically. But life down here isn’t ideal, so we’re left to do what we can with the pieces that remain.",

      "text": "No, there’s something more going on here than you’re giving credit to. Your comment on running is historically correct. Look at the chart from last year. That wasn’t an outlier. That’s how it is every year. The best offenses pass and the worst ones run. It’s like clockwork. And suddenly this year something really weird and different is happening. \n\nIf you want to say the league has never seen a combo like Lamar and Henry, that’s fair. But the Packers absolutely do not have some outlier talent. They’re a good team! But they’re not historically good. Not only is their OL only pretty good, it’s nowhere near where it has been at other points in Lafleur’s tenure. Another way to point this out, if you just go position by position, you probably prefer every single player on the Eagles offense over every player on the Packers’ offense (and probably over the Saints as well). Same with the Lions - they’re probably more talented than the Packers and Saints at every position. But we’re not seeing these ridiculous outlier performances when the Eagles and Lions are healthy. We’ve *never* seen these ridiculous outlier performances before. \n\nThese teams are running the ball an amount that we’d consider *stupid* in the past few years, but they’re incredibly efficient and they’re even generating explosives like more traditional passing offenses do. That’s really weird! Not everyone can have Lamar Jackson, but the Packers have like a borderline top-8 OL and have 13 total QB runs on the year. You’re asking “what’s next here?” and my guess is that it’s whatever is happening in Green Bay and New Orleans. Green Bay in particular seems very odd. Will they have even a single 2nd team all pro player on offense this year? They have no uniquely talented players, they’re running the ball the 4th most vs. expectation, and they’re [leading the league in explosives](https://packerswire.usatoday.com/2024/10/01/packers-lead-nfl-in-explosive-plays-through-4-weeks-in-2024/#). That’s not how it is supposed to work! The passing offenses are supposed to generate the explosives. Their leading receiver in snap share is mf Romeo Doubs! There is something happening here that is going under-discussed.",

It's the fact that his minnions, which i couldn't kill at least half, deal a fk ton  of dmg. So just from minions in a single fight i get half hp'd so i am forced to back. So no time to fast push after i kill him, cuz he just insta clears the next wave and by the time i arive on lane, he is shoving into my turret.\n \nNo, i don't play TP, i play Barrier, it's more utilitarian, and i don't use ignite cuz i need a target for it. So if i try to run, that extra burst of ms from activating barrier is far better than just inting.\n \nA benefit, since i can also kill minions faster post 5, i usually kill laner, fast push, take plate, back, roam a lane, and by the time the laner is back, the third wave normalises in the middle and i get to get 1-2 more kills or assists on another lane. By the time i reach mid, his third and second wave are left in maybe 4-5 minions under my turret, so i lost a wave +-2 minions, but i just burst the shit out of the enemy, send him to the goulag or at least close to it, so i can recover. But these scenarios are rare, and i have to make the perfect play and decision and an exact point in time, else i lose way too much exp and gold which would've kept me ahead and would've pushed me further.",
